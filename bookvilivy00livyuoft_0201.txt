APPENDJX. 159

8 and 29. 33. 6. In both these cases and al<o in 38. 27. 8 the
order is ex d1'ssz'j>ata..2l'zcga. Judging from the last passage, Ltb. thinks
that some such word as congregali may have fallen out here.

³1 §4 debellatum] Morstadt. MSS. bellatum.

diceret] MSS.; Mdg. reads diceretur, but see note. Ltb. adds
that, if diceretur were the true reading, we should expect neve, not aut.
§ 5. in] Mdg.; wanting in MSS.

32 §6. certam] Mdg.; MSS. claram. The latter might, after all,
be right.

83 §9. Tusculi] Mdg. brackets the first Tusculi, but this does not
seem necessary.

84 ἓ r. tantum] Mag„ who compares c. 38. 5. MSS. lanto.

35 § 4. pensionibus] Cuiacius. MSS. portionibus.

§9. qua] So better MSS. Inferior MSS. quam, which many
adopt, translating ⁴ which you hear our colleagues chanting in accord.'

36 §8. animi, vocibus alienis] After MP, which have vocalienz‘s.
Other MSS. vocum alienis and vocem aliem's. Mdg. reads animis a
voce alienis.

³⁹7 §a plebes fecisset] So inferior MSS. M plebi fecissent, which
Harant would read.

ἓ 6. quid-J Doujat. MSS. qui.

octona loca] For the question as to the number of the consular
tribunes, ef. Grecnidge, Roman Public Life, p. 112 n. It should be
mentioned that a fragment of the fasti consulares recently found gives
the names of nine consular tribunes for the year 380 B.C., under which
year Livy (c. 27) gives six and Diodorus eight names (15. 50). See
Mommsen in Hermes 1903,⁴ pp. 116 ff„ where it is shown that the nine
names are probably (lue to the blencling together of various sources.

38 ἓ 1. qui] So inferior MSS. MP quia, which might be right

§3. ad civem] MSS. Mdg. brackets ad. H..J M. takes ad
from before civem and places it before summum imperium, while Ltb.
inserts an additional ad before the latter words.

40 ἓ 11. non...1icebit‚ ut] Mdg. ; MSS. ‘non' inquit ‘ licebit; lu...'.
The latter might be right: ‘ you will not be allowed to do so,' says he ;
‘you would pass the bills...and this portent would not take place.’

§17. consule] Mdg.; MSS. consulem, which would make haud
pro dubio an adverbial expression.

41. ἓ 3. erili] Wesenberg. MSS. sit.

ξ 4. etenim] MSS. ; Mdg. at enim.
§6. privati] Crevier. MSS. privatim.
