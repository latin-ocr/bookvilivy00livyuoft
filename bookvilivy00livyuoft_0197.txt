APPENDIX ΟΝ THE TEXT OF BOOK VI.

All the existing MSS. of the first decade of Livy are, with one ex·
ception, founded on a recension of the text made by one Victorianus
towards the end of the fourth century. In this recension the sixth book,
together with the seventh and eighth, was revised by Nicomachus
Flavianus; the third, fourth, and fifth books were allotted to his son
Nicomachus Dexter. Of the MSS. the most important are the Medicean
(M) in Florence‚ of the elevemh century, and the Parisian (P), of the
tenth century„ Resides these there exists a much earlier MS„ the codex
Veronensis of the fourth century. It contains the greater part of the
third, fourth, and fifth books, and parts of the early chapters os the sixth,
viz. of cc. 1. 3 to 4. 9 and cc. 6. 4 to 7. 1. The opinion of Prof.
Mommsen, who published this MS. in the Commentationes of the
Berlin Academy of 1868, is that it goes back to an archetype anterior
to the Nicomachean recension; hence its importance. The MS. (known
as V) is, however, inferior as a whole to the Nicomacbcan archetype,
though it has, as will be seen, in some cases preserved the true reading.
