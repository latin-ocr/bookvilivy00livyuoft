ιδ ἓ 3. emissum...sig·num] The loss of a standard was considered
such a disgrace, that troops would use every exertion to recover one
which had fallen into the enemy's hands; cf. 3. 70. 10, 11: arrepta
signa ab signiferis 2‘p5e inferre, quaedam iacere etiam in confertos hostes
coepi& cuius rgmominz'ae metu concitati milites invasere hostem: cf. also
the peculiar satissaction of Augustus at the recovery (in ἰο 13.C.) of the
standards captured by the Parthians at Carrhae 3 there are coins with the

legend siguis Parthicis receptis, and the event is particularly recorded on
the lllonumentum A ncyranum.

19 ferunt] ‘ it is said.’

20 antesignanos] The front line or hastati3 cf. c. 7. 3 n., and 8. 1 1. 7-:

22 ξ 4. subsidiarios] These corresponded to the triarii of the Roman
legi0n3 cf. 8. 11. 7 where it is said that, after the defeat of the hastati

hastam z'nfines eorum emittebat : cf. also c. 9. 4: cum...molirentur.

the parma to defend himself with in an infantry fight.

²9 ἓ ’1. inclinata res erat] ‘ the fortune of the day had turned‚' i.e. in
