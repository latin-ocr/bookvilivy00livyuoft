18 in hac magnificentia] We can probably see here an allusion to the
activity of Augustus in erecting magnificent buildings in Rome; at the
time Livy was writing (between 27 and 20 B.C.; cf. Introd. ἓ 1) that
policy of rebuilding Rome would be taking shape, which caused
Augustus to boast (urbem) marmoream se relinquere, quam latet-12 iam
accepisset (Suet. Aug. 28). Pliny (N. H. 36. ¹04) remarks the wonder
excited by the supporting wall os the Capitolium : senes...insanas Capimt'i
substructiones mirabamur.

contio was an informal mass-meeting held by any magistrate; here it is
opposed to the formal concilium plebis at which resolutioris were passed

20 legibus agrariis] These laws dealt with the disposal of the ager
publicus, or domain land, which had been acquired by conquest. Os
the cultivated land thus gained large portioris were from time to time
given in full ownership to Roman' citizens; the allotment to each was
generally two iugera (about 1ss acre), such allotment being frequently
accompanied by the foundation os a colony. On the other hand, the
state retained the ownership of the uncultivated lands, but allowed
citizens to pasture cattle upon them at a proportionate rent (scriptura).
The infrequent allotment of the ager publicus, and the abuse by the rich

on the Pomptine marshes on the N ., though Pliny's statement
(MH. 3. 9. 5), that there were once ²4 flourishing towns in the Palus
Pomptina, might lead us to think that it was the actual marsh district.
The definite acquisition ot this territory, so long ‹lisputed between the
Romans and the Volscians‚ is a clear indication os the growing power os
the former. See map.

23 ἓ a. infestiorem...ab nobilitate] ‘ more threatened by the nobles.’
Infestus here bears the passive sense natural to its form, though the
active sense of ‘hostile' became more common. For another instance
of the passive meaning, cf. 10. 46. 9: quia regio ea infesta ab Samnitibus
erat.

Livy is scarcely correct in saying that the occupation of the ager
