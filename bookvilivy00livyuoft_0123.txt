v111§ 1] NOTES. 81

up in line οἱ battle, Camillus must have passed among the ranks of the
hastati, sacing the rest of the army. But, as the battle had not begun.
it is possible that Livy considered the standards as still in sront of the
whole army.

The szgmum was a lance, furnished on the top with a crossbar, on
which appeared the name of the legion and maniple: below the cross-
bar was a series of metal disks (phalerae), probably awarded to the
company (manipulus) sor conspicuous valour. The division of the
legions into maniples may with probability be assigned to the time
of Camillus. For an illustration of the stgnnm, see Ramsay, Roman
Antiqs.³⁵, p. 426.

obversus] A poetical word, not found in prose before Livy. The
simple versus occurs in c. 20. 9.

27 · quae tfistitia...haec] A departure from the usual order quae haec
tristitia sor the purpose of gaining effect. With a similar object hoslis
est quid aliud is put sor the commonet quid aliud est lzoslis ?

p- 11. 1 §4. et Aequis] See Appendix.

§6. an] Notice that an introducing a question generally expects
the answer ‘no,' just as num does. The reason is that a previous
question wjth utrum is omitted, while the question with an is the less
probable alternative. Thus the full sentence here would have been:
utrum me agnoscitis an non (agnoscitis) deu-cm? ‘Do you recognize
me as your general or can it be that you do not?' Cf. c. 36. 12.

sig-num] The signal that a sight would take place on that day.
This was given by exposing a red flag over the general's tent; cs. Caesar
B. G. 2. 20: Caesari omnia uno tempore erant agenda: vexillum pro-
ponendum (quod erat inszgrne, cum ad arma concurri oporteret); on the
other hand, the signal to begin the fight was given with the *rumpet
(signum tuba dare). This is the signal referred to below, c. 8. 1.

5 animos] ¹ courage.’
8 § Β. simul] = simul ac; cs. c. 1. 6n.

CHAPTER VIII.

¹4 ἓ 1. infer...signum] Each standard formed the rallying point for
a separate division of the Roman legion. The important part played by
the standard may be gathered from the number of military phrases in
which it occurs, e.g. inferre sagnum=to advance, convertere segma:

to wheel (cf. c. ²4· 7 circumagi mgna), signa servare=to keep in
rank, etc.; cf. c. 7. 3 n.
