xxxviii ξ 9] NOTES. 14¹

17 ξ 6. quanto...vineeretur] ‘the veto, though more powerful in law,
was yet being overcome.’ This picture of the nnconstitutional disregard
of the intercessio is probably taken from the events of the last few years
of the life of the Republic.

19 uti rogas] See c. 35. 8 n. At this period, when the voting was by
word of mouth, the words were a direct answer to the magistrate's
question ‘velitis iubeatis, Quirites? ⁷ In later times, when voting was
by tablet, V.R. became merely a conventional sign.

2²4 § 6. intercessioni auxilium] We can easily see how the
original ius auxilii of the tribunes (leveloped into a general power of
velo, which in the end proved fatal to the working of the Republican
Constitution.

26 ἓ ⁰1. nihil] Adverbial: ‘in no way)

27 inseram] From insero, pf. inserui. No patrician magistrate could
preside in a concilium plebis.

253 tendent] The sut. following on the pres, cedunt is quite in Livy’s
manner, and has no special significance. Tendo with inf. does not occur
in strict prose writers, and may be due to the influence of Virgil3 cf.
Aen. 2. 220: ille simul manibus tendit divellere nodos.

32 ἓ 8. emoverem] Another poetical word, used frequently by Livy.
Virgil has it; cf. Aen. 2. 493: emoti procumbunt cardine postes. The
usual word for the moving on of a crowd by a lictor is summovere;
cs. 3. 48. 3: lictor summove turbam.

33 sacramento...adacturum] For the phrase, see c. 32. 4n.

p. 53. 1 ἓθ. incusserat] Another plup. where we should expecta
perf. Perhaps it gives the idea of suddenness, as in c. 34. 2 ; or possibly
eompletion may'be indicated: ‘the effect of this was to inspire great
terror-¹

4 vitio creatus] See c. 1. 5 and c. 27. 5 nn.

5 scivit] The regular word sor a resolution of the plebs; cf. c. 35. 7.
In the case of the Comitia the expression is populus iussit.

6 pro dictatore] ‘ as dictator.’ Distinguish from the later use of pro
in pro consule, pro praetore, etc., where the meaning is rather ‘in place
ofa consul ' than ‘in the capacity of a consul.'

qum egisset] i.e. did anything against the constitution, such as
interfering with the concilium plebis. Even a dictator was bound to
obey the fundamental laws of the constitution, as appears from othei
passages; cf. 7. 3. 9 (very parallel to this), 7. 21. r, 2. No doubt, in
spite of what Livy says in ξ 13, the threat of fine can only refer to a
prosecution to be instituted against Camillus after resignation of the
