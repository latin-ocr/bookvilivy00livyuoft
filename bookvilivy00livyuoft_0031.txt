(1) Rome after the retreat of the Gauls. The misery at
Rome after the retreat of the Gauls must have been terrible.

It is hardly surprising that the sight os the city lying in ruins
should have led to the proposal to emigrate to Veii. The
situation at this moment is graphically described by Plutarch
(Cam. 31): δεομένων (SC. τῶν πολλῶν) μὴ σφᾶς ὥσπερ ἐκ ναυαγίου
γυμνοὺς καὶ ἀπόρους σωθέντας προσβιάζεσθαι τὰ λείψανα τῆς διεφθαρ-
μένης συμπηγνύναι πόλεως, ἐτέρας ἑτοίμης παρούσης. Livy seems
purposely to avoid dwelling upon the utter desolation which
prevailed everywhere, and delights rather to describe the speed
and energy with which the Romans rebuilt their city, and the
reverence for the gods which was their first care (c. 1. 9). But
the effects of the devastation must have been felt for many years
aster, and indeed they can be traced in the internal history of
Rome throughout the sixth book.

Although the Gallie invasion must have affected all classes,
it fell with peculiar severity upon the poor. Their farms no
doubt had been burnt to the ground, their lands ravaged, their
flocks and herds driven off, and all their agricultural implements
destroyed. And now they were called upon to give their services
in rebuilding the city and to contribute to the expenses os such
public works as the sacing of the Capitol with hewn stone
(c 4. 6) and the erectiori of a city wall (c. 32. 1, 2). Absolute
0 ruin was before them, unless they could borrow money for the
repair and restocking os their homesteads; but this was a
desperate remedy and one calculated to intensify the econoniic
troubles, which to a greater or less degree had always been
present at Rome since the establishment of the Republic-

(2) The question of the ager publicus. It was the custom
of the Romans to deprive their vanquished enemies of a large
portion of their territory. Of the land thus won the part
suitable for agriculture ought, according to the recognized
system, to have been divided among the citizens in small allot-
ments; the less fertile districts, especially the uplands‚ were
retained in ownership by the state and let out for the grazing of
cattle at a see (scriptura) proportioned to the number of aninials
