lielmets of iron (ἐχαλκεύσατο μὲν κράνη τοῖς πλείστοις ὁλοσίδηρα καὶ
λεῖα ταῖς περιφερείαις, ὡς ἀπολισθαίνειν ἢ κατάγνυσθαι τὰς μαχαίρας), and
carry brazen shields, aud taught thern to use the pilum as a weapon of
desence, as well as *of offence (αὐτοὺς δὲ τοὺς στρατιώτας ἐδίδαξε τοῖς
ὑσσοῖς μακροῖς διὰ χειρὸς χρῆσθαι καὶ τοῖς ξίφεσι τῶν πολεμίων ὑποβάλ-
λοντας ἐκδέχεσθαι τὰς καταφοράς).

¹3 ἐξ». Claudius] Q. Claudius Quadrigarius, an annalist of the
Sullan age. He recorded the history of Rome from the capture of the
city by the Gauls to his own times. Livy always calls this annalist
Claudius simply, but there is no reason to doubt his identity with
the Q. Claudius Quadrigarius mentioued by Velleius Paterculus and
Aulus Gellius. Claudius, who appears to have been rather more trust-
worthy than the majority of the later annalists, is largely used by Livy
in the 4th decade.

¹4 in ponte pugnam] Cf. vii. 9 and 10; under the year 361 13.c.
Livy there relates the battle between the Romans and Gauls on the
river Anio. Little reliance can be placed on the historical accuracy of
these fights with the Gauls. It is highly probable that in the present
instance the victory of M. Furius Camillus is simply taken stom the
later victory of L. Furius Camillus in 349 13.C. See vii. 26.

17 §6- decem haud minus post annos] A careless statement in
view of Livy's own account in vii. 9. With this use of minus, inserted
as it were parenthetically without affecting the constr. of the sentence,
cf. that of plus and amplius, e.g. amplius dno milia, ‘two miles
and more.'

18 in Albano agro] See map.

§B- palati am...tutati sunt]‚ ‘the rest (alz'z‘icelerir', as osten)
roamed about, the majority making-sor Apulia, and protected them-
selves from their enemy both (cum) by their distant flight and also (lum)
by their wide dispersion, which sear and panic alike had produced.'

24 terrorque] See Appendix.

2 5 consensu patrum plebisque] This does not give the strict con-
stitutional practice with regard to the granting of a triumph. Livy
wishes to depict the unanimity with which Camillus⁵ triumph was
welcomed. The granting of a triumph lay with the Senate alone,
and in 7. 17. 9 we find that a triumph populi iussu was regarded as
unconstitutional. See also 3. 63. 9.

28 §9. dictator senatusque victus] The dictator did not interfere
as in c.- 38. 6 ff. The senate authorised the election os consuls instead of
consular tribuues3 unless, indeed, senalus is used loosely sor patres,
