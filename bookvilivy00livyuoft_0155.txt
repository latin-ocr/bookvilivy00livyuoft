CHAPTER xxl1.

23 ξι. tribunis] See Appendix.

²4 81 qui] ‘ in case any,’ cf. Verg. Am. 1. 181: prospectum late pelago
petil, Anthea si quem Ι iactatum vento videat. The subj. is practically
one of purpose3 ‘in order to check any insumi) Note the variety of
constr. -ad praesidium.. .si qui.

27 ς 2. ita, ut] ‘ with the result that!

30 ξε. et anceps erat nec...censebant] The ‘patriotic’ spirit in
which the Roman annalists wrote comcs out in this sentence. We may
suspect that the difficulty of the operations was chiefly responsible sor
the action of the Romans. A similar spirit can be seen in the accounts
given of the defeat on the Allia. WVeiss. quotes 8. 14. 5 to show how
sar scruples with regard to colonies sufficed to restrain the Romans.

p. 31. 1 ξας. ex senatus consulto populique iussu] The correct ⁷
constitutional procedure3 cf. e. ‘21- 3n.

3 coloniam populi Romani] (js. c. 16. 6n.

14 ἓ 6. extra ordinem decretum] i.e. was assigned by the Senate
contrary lo *the usual procedure. The consuls or consular tribunes
usually determined their sphcres of operation either by mutual agree-
ment (comparatio) or by lot (sors) 3 cf. c. 30. 3. Later on, indeed, the
Senate arrogated to itself [he right of assigning the prwinciac of the
magistrates, but at this period it did so, in all probability, only by
special request. Cf. 8. 16. 5: et ne forte casu erraretur, petitum ab
consulibus, ut extra sorte-m Corvi ea provincia esscl; also 37. 1. 7:
(Laelius), cum senatus aut sortiri aut comparare inter se provincias
consules iussisset, elegantius fitcluros dixit, si iudicio patrum quam si
sorti eam rem permulsissent. The present unusual mode of appoint-
ment gave Camillus a moral, if not a legal, precedence over his
colleague, whose position was the result os the lot.

16 non tam e re publica] ‘not so much (as it proved) to the advantage
of the state.‘ Livy here anticipates.

18 restituit] The subject, which is suddenly changed, is M. Furius
Camillus. This change of subject is not uncommon in Livy; cf.
c. 40. 3.

19 ἓ '7- exactae iam aetatis] ‘ advanced in years.’ A descriptive gen.
The phrase implies that a man’s active career is finished.

20 comitflsque lutare parato in verba excusandae valetudini] ‘at the
electioris, when he was prepared to repeat on oath the sorm os words
