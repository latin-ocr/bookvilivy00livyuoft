144 LIVY. VJ. [xxxix§7

¹7 fulmen] Equivalent to ‘overpowcring might! Livy had probably
taken the expression from the poets; cs. Lucr. 3. 1034: Scipiadas, belli
fultum, Cat-lhagt'm's horror, and Verg. Aen. 6. 842: duo fulmina belli,
Scipiadas. Cicero (pro Balbo 34) has a similar expression.

21 ἓ 9. forum] The spot where many distressing scenes would occur
as the result of the harsh law os debt3 cf. c. ¹4· 3. It was in the
sorum that the debtor was finally handed over to the mercy os his
creditor.

23 ἓ 10. aestimaturos] The or. recta would be quando..aestimabitis?
We should therefore expect a subj. in the or. obliqua according to strict
rule. But the question is virtually rhetorical and equal to a neg.
statement, nunquam aestimaturos3 cf. c. 17. 511.

25 meidant] Note the quantity, incidere, ‘to cut away.' For the
gerundive with inter, cf. c. 11. 5 n.

²7 per quos] Again the absence of a connecting particle serves to
bring out the contrast sorcibly.

senes] No doubt with reference to consenuisse in ἓ 6.

τι) relinquat] lx'elz'nqucre, parallel to postulare, might have been
expected. As it is, we must supply another ut, dependent upon
peslulare.

§11- statuerent] Many instances of the varying use of primary
and secondary tenses of the subj. in or. obliqua have occurred
before3 cf. c. 6. 8ff: creasset...possit, etc., c. 17. 3: iugulentur...
fingerent...respondewm c. 23. 10, 11, etc. The present passage,
however, shows the variation so strikingly, that it seemed best to
reserve discussion of the constr. sor this place. In an Appendix to
his edition of Bk. 11, Prof. Conway has examined Livy's use of primary
and secondary tenses os the snbj. in or. obliqua aster a past vb. of
saying or thinking. He shows that, with a few exceptions, Livy is
in the habit of keeping the tense of the or. recta, wherever practicable.
But since this is impossible in the case of the Imperative, Fut., and Fut.
Pers. Ind., he usually converts these into secondary tenses of the subj.
Thus in ἓ 10 relinquat repeats the pres· subj. os the recta, but statuerent
represents the imperat. staluz'le. In the next sentence, vellent and nfice-
rent are not in accordance with Prof. Conway’s rule, but seem, as he

says, to be under the influence of the secondary tenses immediately pre·
ceding; a return is made to the primary tenses with opus sit and velint
(ἓ 12). For further information on this point Pros. Conway's Appendix
should be consulted.

Exceptions to the canon appear to occur in c. 6. 8: creasset sor
