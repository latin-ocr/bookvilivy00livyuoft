ΧΧΙΧ §9] NOJES. 125

For the meaning os ω, cf. 7. 39. 10: c.·.· iniuria insanientis. See
Appendix.

¹4 tumultuario] ‘hasty-¹ Cf. 5. 37. 7: tumultuario exercitu, ‘a
hastily levied army.⁷ See Appendix.

15 recepissent] The subj. is due to the thought implied in nc. The
direct would be: si intra moenia nos receperimus, c.1·lcntpl0 uri-tur
ager.

depopulatis] Pers. part. of deponent verb used passively. With
depopulor this use of the perf. part. is common in all writers3 cf.
Caesar B. G. 1. 11. 3: depopulatis agris.

18 ἓ ⁵. oppido...Praeneste] Instrumental abl. after includunt.

19 §6- oppida] Cf. c. 4. 8n. Similarly we find srnaller townslrips
dependent upon Tibur (7. ¹9- 1).

26 § 8. signum] This custom of removing the gods of a conquered
city to Rome was a common one; cf. 5. 22. 3sf.‚ where, aster the
capture os Veii, the statue of Iuno Regina is carried to Rome with
elaborate ceremonial.

Cicero (νει-ν. 2. 4. 129) says that T. Quinctius Flamininus removed
a statue of Iuppiter Imperator (ΡΞΖεὺς Στρατηγός or Στράτιος) from
Macedonia, and placed it on the Capitol. Cicero clearly knows of no
other statue“os Iuppiter Imperator at Rome, and we can hardly help
concluding that Livy has made the serious mis-take of consounding
T. Quinctius Cincinnatus with T. Quinctius Flamininus, the conqueror
of Macedonia.

27 Iovis Imperatores] Probably the Latin equivalent of the Roman
Iuppiter Optimus Maximus, the ruling and presiding deity among the
gods.

ς Θ. inter cellam Iovis ac Minervae] See c. 4. 311. There must
have been a doorway leading from the one cella to the other, and the
statue would be placed in a niche made in one of the sideposts.

28 tabula] That there was some confusion regarding the nature os the
offering dedicated by T. Quinctius Cincinnatus is shown by a passage
[rom Festus (p. 363): lrz'eulem (artium pondo coronam auream dedisse
se lovi donum scripsit T. Quinctius, cum per novem dies totidem urbes cl
decimam Praenesle cepisset. Here mention is made os a goldeu crown
οἱ ἰᾖ pounds, but not of a statue.

²9 fuit] implies that the inscription had disappeared in Livy’s day;
the firme shows that his knowledge of it was not at first hand. Perhaps
fuit also indicates a state (remained inscribed) in contrast to the single
act oi dedication (dedicatum est); cf. c. 3. 8 n.
