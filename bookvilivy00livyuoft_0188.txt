146 LlVY. Vl. [x1,§3

¹3 ς’ 3. adversatos esse] Note the sudden change of subject, not
nnconnnon in Livy.

14 ς· 4. infitias eo] Infilz'as is an acc. of motion towards. Literally,
‘1 procecd to a (lenial ’3 cf. exsequias ire, ‘to attend a funeral.’ This
is an instance in which later Latin reverts to a constr. common in ante-
classical Latin. Livy uses the phrase several times.

adsciti sumus] For the migration of Attus or Attius Clausus,
afterwards called App. Claudius, srom Sabine territory to Rome, and
his subsequent enrolment among the patres, see 2. 16. 4, 5.

ι 5 enixe] Cf. c. 24. 1111.: virtutis enixae.

ιδ ἕ 5. ausim]:ausus sim, a subj. of mild assertion; the form is an
archaic one. It is remarked that this is the only occasion on which
Livy uses ausim in a positive sentence.

19 ,aliam incolenti urbem] The phrase vividly describes the real
position of the plebs at the earliest period of the struggle. Patricians
and plebeians were as two peoples within one city, each with its own
magistrates and assembly.

20 quis] Construe closely with nisi.

24 §6- Claudiae familiae] Probably here not used loosely sor
Claudiae gentis, butz‘of a branch os the Claudian clan.' Each gens
was dividet] into a number of familiae, usually distinguished by a special
cognomen. In ἓ 3, above, gens and fizmt'lia are apparently synonymous.

26 duobus ingenuis] If the father or mother had been servile, the son
would have ranked as a libertinus.

ὦ § '7- si dis placet] Ironical.

²9 negent...non...non] Cf. c. 16. 3 and c. 23. 9nn. The repetition
strengthens the negation.

32 ἓ 8. quid. est aliud dicere 2⁷] ‘that is the same as saying.’

p, 56. 4 ἐξ). coniunctim] Cf. c. 39.·11: conium-te. Another instance
of Livy's love of variety.

5 ἕ 10. Tarquinii] The noun in apposition takes an adjectival
meaning, ‘tyrannons.' For a similarly free use of a proper name, cf.
sullaturin', ‘to play the Su11a‚’ a word coined by Cicero (ad Att.
9. 10. 6).

6 succlamare] A word of which Livy is fond, but which does not
occur in Cicero or Caesar. It generally expresses a reply or objection,
as here.

bona venia vestra] Again has an ironical ring : ‘ be so good as to.’

ὃ §3 n. ‘non’ inquit ‘licebit‚ ut...’] For the reading and punctu-
