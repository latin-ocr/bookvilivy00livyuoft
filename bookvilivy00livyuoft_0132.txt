3¹ conveniat] Potential subj. ‘A fact upon which all authorities
would be agreed‚' sc. if they were consulted; cs. Tac. llist. 3. 75: quod
inter omues constiterit, decus domus penes Sabinum erat.

p. 17. 2. Circeiensium] Circeii was a town on the sea-coast, S.W. of
the Pomptine marshes. See map. Cf. α. 39. 2, where the place, which
had originally received Roman colonists, falls back into the hands os the
Volscians. Diod. (14. ¹02) says (under the year 39013.c.): ἀπέστη δὲ ν
καὶ Σάτρικον ἀπὸ Ῥωμαίων, καὶ εἷς Κερκίους ἀποικίαν ἀπέστειλαν, so it
appears to have been again a Latin colony at this time.

a Velitris] Cf. 2. 31. 4: Velitras coloni ab urbe missi. The colony
was Latin, not Roman (cf. c. 17. 7n.), and lay a little to the S. of
the Mons Albanus. See map. The variety of constr. should be
noticecl.

3 §¹7. auspicato] The gods were consulted before the commence-
ment of a battle by means of the auspices3 it was an accepted principle
with the Romans that no important business should be entered upon
without such consultation. The auspices before battle were generally
drawn srom the manner in which the sacred chickens (pulli) fed3 cf.
c. 41. Sn. Auspicato is abl. abs.‚ as litato, angurat03 the usage, how-
ever, tends to become purely adverbia13 cf. falso, merito, ete.

4 hostiaque caesa] It was of the utmost importance that the sacrifice
of the vietim should be attended by favourable signs. The loss of the
battle on the Allia was partly attributed to fighting in the face of un-
savourable omens ; cf. c. 1. 12: quod...non litasset Sulpicius.

pacem deum] Cf. c. 1. 12.

5 signum] Probably the red flag hung from the general’s tent3 cf.
c. 7. 5n.

in futurum] ‘into the future.’ Neut. of sut. part. used as subst.

9 pilis ante pedes positis] Cf. 7. 16. 5: ‘aspir-2, irnpm·ator,’ inquit,
‘ quemadmodum exercitus tuus tz'bz' promissa praestet) piloque posito stricto
gladio in hostem impetum fecit ς cf. also 2. 30. 12. The pilum was a
strong javelin, about 6 st. 9 in. long, with barbed iron head. It was
generally used for throwing, and was not suitable for a fight at close
quarterS. ’

11 obnixos vos stabili gradu] ‘bearing up with feet firm-planted’; cf.
Tyrtaeus frag. 9. 21 (Bergk) :

ἀλλά τις εὖ διαβὰς μενέτω ποσὶν ἀμφοτέροισιν
στηριχθεὶς ἐπὶ Ὑῆς, χεῖλος ὀδοῦσι δακών.

In both cases the altitude of brave men fighting against odds.
