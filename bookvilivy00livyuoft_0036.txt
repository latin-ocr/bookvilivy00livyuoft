the terrible inequality existing between the rich and the poor,
and the misery brought about by the systematic borrowing to
which the poor were driven. Manlius is the champion of the
poor sarmer‚ who finds it impossible to make a living in the
face of innumerable difficulties, and who is in the end at the
mercy of the large landowner. Prof. Mommsen thinks that
the picture of Manlius, the debtors' champion‚ is borrowed
from the disturbances which arose in consequence of the
prevalence of debt after the Social Ὄνεια that his death is
the counterpart of that of the praetor Asellio, who in 89 B.C.
was inurdered by enraged creditors for administering the law
in favour of debtors. Prof. Pais, on the other hand, thinks
that the material for Livy's description has been drawn from
the agitations of the 3rd century ΒΕ. But after all the essentia}
part of the story may well be true for the period following the
Gallie invasion, when distress must have been widespread and
the harsh character of the law of debt must have been felt
more keenly than ever. This is the fact that is brought
before us in Livy's brilliant narrative, which may be considered
to have a value very similar to that of the numerous speeches
inserted by the historiam, the chief sunction of which is to
represent more or less accurately the feelings produced by a
particular situation. We can well believe that at this period
a patrician came sorward, at first as the genuine champion
of the wrongs of the plebeians; that the temptation to turn
the existing discontent to his own advantage proved too strong
for him, and that in the end he perished in an attempt to
establish a tyranny. ¹

criticisms which have been brought against the account of the
great internal conflicts‚ as narrated at the end of book Vl, may
first be considered. As in the case of the details of the various
wars and of the story of Manlius, so here also most of t'ne
incidents which serve merely to enliven the narrative may be
put aside as unhistorical. The tale of the sisters Fabiae makes
an excellent introduction to the events which follow, but bears
upon the face of it the stamp of a late and untrustworthy origin.
