JA'TA’OD UCTlOlV. §4 xxxiii

makes no mention os a provision sor the compulsory employ-
ment os a certain percentage of free labourers; that was a
measure called sor by later economic conditions only. But
such a clause would almost certainly have been inserted by
him among the Licinio-Sextian laws, had they been simply
transferred from the znd century 8.(3. to the 4th. With iegard
to the first law it is intrinsically probable that some measure
was passed at this time for the relies of the suffering debtors‚
and the proposal to remit interest on loans was not an ex-
travagant one in view of the special hardships prevailing. The
thr-owing open of the consulship to the plebeians about this
period may be regarded as certain; sor this we have the
authority of Fabius Pictor (ap. Aul. Geli. 5. 4): qua propter
tum primum ex plebe aller consul sactus cst, duo et vicesimo
anno postquam Romam Galli ceperunt. The stipulation that
one consul must be a plebeian was, however, not infrequently
disregarded on subsequent occasions. There is no adequate
reason sor discrediting the statement that the college for the
custody of the Sibylline Books was now made accessible to
plebeian candidates. It was connected with the cult of Apollo,
and, though of great importance sor the development os the
Roman religion, would be considered less exclusively patrician
than those colleges os priests which were concerned with deities
of a peculiarly Roman character.

Some estimate of the importance os the Licinio—Sextian laws
may now be made. As has been often pointed out, they
indicate a combination of the richer and poorer plebeians for
the purpose of wringing from the patricians advantages which
could only be gained by a united effort. Many plebeians were
well enough off materially‚ and no doubt exercised their ad-
vantage over debtors to the full as cruelly as any of the
patricians did. But the consular tribunate did not give them
the outward distinctions, such as the ius imaginum, which
were the object of their ambiti0n‚ and was, moreover, very
hard to win in the sace of patrician intrigue; cf. c. 32. 3, and
c. 34. 3: adeo ergo obnoxios sunmziseranl animos, non infimi
solum, sed principes etiam plebis, ut non modo ad tribunatum
militum inter patricios petendum... sed nc ml plebeios quidem
