7 ς 16. dicitur] Livy, though he clearly has no sympathy with
Manlius, maintains his reputation sor candour. There was considerable
difference of opinion among Roman writers as to the guilt or innocence
of Manlius. Plut. Cam. 36 says that he was condemned ἐπὶ τεκμηρίοις
φανεροῖς; Cicero (Phil. 2. 44. [14) is vague: propler suspicionem regni
appetendi: Servius on Aen. S. 652, on the other hand, thinks the
condemnation unsair: lisanlius...inimicorum oppressus factione. Cf. c.
το. 4.

clun quibus] Some suitable word must be supplied srom pervenerint,
which, though only applicable to adfinem, is by zeugma connected with
cmn quibus as well. Livy never seems to use quibuscum, which is the
ordinary form in Cicero; cf. 1. 45. 2, 4. 24. 2, 38. 9. 2. But in the
present instance we feel that cum quibus is more natural than quibuscum,
perhaps because quibus is interrogative, not relative.

13 ς 1. domum privatam] See c. 18. 311.

15 mole] ‘ trouble‚’ ‘danger‚’ cs. c. 2. 11 n.

ἓ 2. Servilio Ahala] We should say, ‘of a Servilius Ahala.' It
was he who& as Master of the Horse, struck down Sp. Maelius in
439 B.c.: cf. c. ¹7· zn.

17 iactura] Properly used of the throwing overboard of cargo in order
to lighten a ship in distress; from this comes the general meaning
‘sacrifice’; ef. 5. 39. 12 : siv-ilem iacturam esse seniorum, and Iuv. 3.
125: nusquam minor est {astura clientis, ‘the throwing overboard of
a client.’

18 ἓ 8. decurritur] ‘recourse was had to,² implying more or less
extreme measures. With thc whole sentence, cf. Caesar Β. C. 1. 5

(the final breach between Caesar and the Senate): decurritur ad illum ,

extremum atque ultimum senalus consultum, qua, m‘si paene in ipso urbis
incendio atque in desperatione omnium salutis, lnlorum audacia nunquam
ante descensum est.
vim] Exactly our ‘force'

ιι) ut videant magistratus, etc-J Cf. 3. 4. 9. This was the regular
formula of the senatus consultum ultimum, which practically amounted
to the declaration of martial law. It is almost certain that Livy is
guilty of an anachronism in placing the s.c. ultimum so early as this.
The truth is that, so long as the dictatorship existed, this measure was
superfluous. But aster the Second Punic War the dictatorship died out,
and the s.c. ultimum took its place. It was the weapon employed against
