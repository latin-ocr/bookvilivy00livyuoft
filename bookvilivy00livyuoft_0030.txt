xxiv LIVY. Vl.

A second cause (or possibly result) of disaffection was the closing
of the Latin League about 385 ss.c.¹ Henceforward new colonies
did not become members of the Latin League ; in other words
they were bound directly to Rome and had no relations with
the other Latin cities. Satricum (c. 16. 6) seems to have been
the last colony admitted to the full rights os the League. Rome
was henceforth determined to concentrate all power directly in
her own hands.

The city had only just freed herself from the Gallie invasion,
when the attitude of the Latins and Hernicans began to occasion
serious alarin (e. 2. 3). The curious story (see Plut. Cam. 33) of
the demand made by the Latins that the Roman maidens should
be given to them in marriage and of its frustration by the wit of
the serving girl Philotis (or Tutela), though of course quite un-
historical, is yet an indication of the existence of a general belief
that the allies took advantage of Rome's hour of weakness. It
is true that at first the ruling bodies in the Latin cities did not
venture to proceed to overt acts of hostility, but the spirit of
discontent revealed by the help given to the Antiates by Latin
volunteers (c. 6. 4) was bound sooner or later to force the
governments into open warfare. In 383 ΒΕ. the Latin city of
Lanuvium rose in rebellion, and the colonies of Circeii and
Velitrae joined in bearing arms against Rome (c. 21. 2). The
example set by these places was followed by Praeneste (c. 22),
which was not subdued until after it had occasioned considerable
alarm in Rome (cc. 28, 29). The attitude of Tusculum also was
so unsatisfactory that the Romans thought it advisable to compel
its citizens to receive the civitas sine szffvzgz'o (see c. 26. 8 n.)‚ thus
depriving the town of the right to exercise any independence in
external affairs. Though these sporadic attempts at rebellion
on the part of the Latins were overpowered without great
difficulty, it was evident that the existing state of things could
not last much longer. Either Rome or Latium must be supreme,
and there was little doubt as to which side would gain the
victory in the approaching struggle.

¹ This closing of the Latin League is inferred from the absence of

colonies,>known to be founded aster this date, from the list of iederal
cities given by Dionysius (v. 61).
