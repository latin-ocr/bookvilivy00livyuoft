vi PREFACE.

Roman ssllvfaewry, Rb'misclze Forsclmngen, and Rb‘misclzes
Staatsrcclzt, as well as of the various dictionaries and
manuals of Antiquities3 Pais's Storia di Roma has proved
occasionally suggestive‚ but, as I have remarked elsewhere,
must be used with the greatest cantion. In writing the
introduction I frequently consulted Weissenborn’s introduc-
tion to his edition of Livy. Warde Fowler's lee Roman
Festivals and Greenidge’s Roman Public Life should also
be mentioned. Ι may add that it has been one of my chief
ainis to explain and illustrate with care points of historical
and archaeological interest connected with the book.

The maps are based on those given in Conway’s edition
of Book 11„ but considerable alterations have been made
to suit the requireinents of the present hook.

Finally I have to express my warmest thanks to Mr P.
Giles of Emmanuel College for his great kindness in reading
through the whole of the introduction and notes in proof‚
and for contributing many valuable suggestions.
