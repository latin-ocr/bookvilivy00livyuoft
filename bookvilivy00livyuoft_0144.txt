Livy's fondness sor rhetoric. Cf. Introd. ξ 3.

20 Iove] In the temple of Jupiter was his terracotta image, covered
with costly robes, with the sace painted scarlet-the sign n! a
triumphator.

‘21 ἓ 5. selibrisne farris] Cf. 5. 47. 8. The soldiers presented
Manlius with what was of the greatest value during the privations of
a siege3 each gave‹ a hals- pound of ineal and a quat-'lamus (ah out¹ gpint)
oswine. Asterwards, however, the gift seemed but mean.

22 Capitolino] Join with Iovi. Cf. c. 5. 611. and see Appendix.

²3 pati] This, as representing patimini in the or. recta, should by
strict rule be palm-culm: The rule is that questions in the ist and 3rd
persons in the or. recta, which are generally rhetorical and do not call

himself that the release was essected.
