progress towards the final conquest of these foes. The Volscian
territory extended S. of Latium along the coast up to the river
Liris, while on the E. it was bounded by the mountainous
country of the Hernicans and Marsians. The most reliable
evidence of Rome's progress is to be sought in the foundation
of Latin colonies, which are pushed forward into the beart of
the Volscian territory. Fighting goes on between the Romans
and the Volscians almost uninterruptedly for thirteen years
(389——377 B.c.), and in spite of the aid given to the Volscians
by several of the Latin colonies the balance of success lies with
the Romans. Here again the details of the wonderful victories
gained by Camillus may be set aside; we must be content to
see in Livy's account a picture of the general course of the war.
In 385 B.C. Satricum, which commanded the coast district near
Antium, was colonised (c. 16. 6> and notwithstanding the con-
flagration recorded in c. 33, it seems to have remained a Latin
stronghold. In 379 13.c. (c. 30. 9) the Romans are found
strengthening their position at Setia, a fortress protecting the
· Pomptine district, while the surrender of Antium two years later
marks an important step in advance (c. 33). Henceforward the
Volscians never appear really dangerous, and Rome passes
on beyond their borders to engage a new enemy, the Samnites.

(3) 'l'he Latius and the Hernicans. The league renewed
between the Romans and the Latins in 493 Rc. and that con-
cluded between the former and the Hernicans in 486 ΒΩ. were
ι based ostensibly upon a condition of equality between the con-
tracting parties. But as time went on the control of foreign
relations (such a statement as that in 8. 2. ¹3 notwithstanding)
and the chief military command probably fell into the hands of
the Romans exclusively 3 and though the Latins were granted a
share in the colonies founded by the League in conquered
territory, they could not fail to see that they obtained no
adequate return for the assistance granted to Rome against her
enemies. The first open expression on the part of the Latins of
q a discontent which must long have existed secretly, occurs in
this book of Livy. The chief cause of this spirit of revolt was
undoubtedly the belief that Rome had become seriously weakened
by the Gallic invasion and could now be defied with impunity.
