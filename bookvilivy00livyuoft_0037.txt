JA’TJeOD Uc'TlON. 4. xxxi

the intermission os the curule magistracies confirm the suspicions
which are naturally aroused by the intrinsic improbability ot
such a state of affairs, at least for any considerable time. Livy
(c. 35. 10) makes the solitudo nzqcistratuunz last for five years;
Dio Cassius (ap. Zon. 7. 24) puts it down as of four years’
duration; while, according to Diodorus (15. 75), it was only
sor one year. Here again Diodorus' account would seem much
the most reasonable. With the traditional part assigned to
Camillus in these struggles Livy himself is not altogether
satisfied (c. 38. 9), and a certain amount of scepticism as to
the prominent position given to that hero does not necessarily
shake our saith in the essential parts of the narrative. The
various speeches of Licinius and-Sextius and that of App.
Claudius Crassus are clearly to be received in the spirit in
which they are given to us, that is to say, they are not intended
for accurate reports of speeches actually made, but are designed
to illustrate the feelings which animated the respective parties
in the struggle.

But not merely the comparatively unimportant details have
met with criticism. The actual legislation attributed to Licinius
and Sextius has been called in question ¹. It will be well first
to give their proposals as we find them in Livy (c. 35). They
were (a) de aere alieno: that the interest already paid should
be deducted from the original debt, and that the remainder
should be paid off in three instalments. This simply amounted
‘to the abolition of interest on loans. (b) de modo agrorum:
that no person should occupy more than 500 z‘ugym of the
ager publicus. (c) T hat the election of consular tribunes should
cease, and that one at least of the two consuls should be a
plebeian. Another proposal was added subsequently, viz.
(d) that the keepers of the Sibylline Books should in future
be ten instead of two in number, and that of these half should
be patricians, half plebeians (c. 37. 12). The most serious
criticisrn has been directed against the law which imposed a
limit upon the occupatiori of the ager publicus. The well-
known land law of Tib. Gracchus (133 stc.) was identical in
