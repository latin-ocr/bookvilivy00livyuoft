the various branches of a gens. The present cognomen Fidenas is,
exceptionally {or this early period, derived from a place originally
outside Roman territory. Vcry probably it was gained as the result
of some military exploit, or it might possibly indicate a foreign origin
for the Servilii.

32 §8. namque] Strict Classical prose writers always place namque
first in a sentence. Livy departs from this rule. He also places itaque
(c. 8. ὃ) and zgrimr (e. 9. 5) in positions unusual in prose writing,
possibly as a result of the inssuence of the poets.

p, ’7. 1 ab odio] ‘out of hatred’3 cs. c. 2. 9 n.

2 relinquerent] See Appendix.

Tarquiniensem] Tarquinii lay in Etruria, W. of the Ciminian
forest, not sar from the sea-coast ; Cortuosa and Contenebra would be
townships dependent on it. Similarly Praeneste had eight smaller town-
ships, which depended on it (c. ²9· 6). It is noteworthy that this
expedition took the Romans beyond the formidable barrier of the Mons
Ciminius. Cf. 9. 36. 1, and see map.

5 ξ 9. primo clamore] Cf. Gk αὐτοβοεί.

7 ἓ 10. laborque] The -que may have an adversative force, ‘the
town stood a siege for a few days, yet the unremitted efforts, etc.'
(Weiss. compares c. 16. 5 z dictator de Volscis triumphavit invidiaeque
magis triumphus quam gloriae full), or else it may express simple
sequence of events.

8 eos]:ct‘ves; cf. c. 3. 2 n. The idea os the citizens is contained in the
name of the town.

9 senis horis ‘m orbem] ‘for periods of six hours in rotati0n‚' i.e. each
division fought for six hours, and then rested sor thirty. Cf. 5. 19. ιιι
in parles sex munitorum numerum divisit: senae horae in orbem operi
‹zttrz'bulac sunt. Luterbacher takes the meaning to be that each division
fought for one honr only, and then had five hours’ rest. But in that case
we should expect rather singulis horis, and there is the further objection
that such frequent changes in attack would lead to endless confusion.
lt must be admitted, however, that thirty hours is a long time sor rest,
and Mr Giles suggests that there may be some corruption in the
numbers3 possibly the army was divided into four not six parts.

ι 2 ἓ 11. tribunis] i.e. the military tribunes with consular powers.

sed imperium...fuit] ‘but their orders lagged behind their purpose.'

¹7 ἓ 12. capitolium...substruetum] The object would be partly to
preventrthe scaling of the citadel by a foe (the Gallie attempt had been
a warning), and partly to lessen the danger ol rocks lalling lrom the
