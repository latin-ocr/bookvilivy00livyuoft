62 LJVY. VJ. [1 §2

parvae] ‘scanty,' referring to meagre annalistic notices. For Livy‘s
use of the earliest sources of Roman history, see Introd. §m

una custodia fidelis memoriae rerum gestarum] Very characteristic
os Livy, who was by no means a lover of archaeological research. But
‘the Record of the Huinan Past is not all contained in printed books,’
and monuments are osten more faithful recor-ders of the past than are
written documents.

in commentariis pontificum] These books contained primarily the
decrees of the poulifices touching religious matters. But Livy evidently
regards thern as also concerned with historical records, though perhaps
only incidentally. Cf. 4. 3. 9, where Canuleius, in proposing his laws,
says: sinon ad fastos, non acl commentarios pontificum admittimur, ne
ea quidem scimus, quae omnes peregrini etiam sciunt, consules in locum
regum successisse? At the same time we cannot help suspecting that
Livy is confusing the commentarii with the annales maximi, the latter
being a record of the chief events of each year, drawn up by the
Pontifex Maximus.

publicis] Such as laws (eg. the XII Tables) and treaties.

privatis] Family records, laudationes or funeral orations, which
were a frequent cause of the falsification of history, and the inscriptions
(tituli) placed beneath the imagines or masks of distinguished members
of a family. These last were also in many cases mere fabrications;
cf. 8. 40. 4: falsis imaginum titulis.

ἓ 3. The sentence ¹‘is a little complicated. Rome, aster the burning,
is likened to a tree which has been cut down, whose roots, however, are
still sound. Translate: ‘clearer theneesorward and more certain will
be the record of the history of the city both at home and abroad, from
the time os its second foundation, when it sprang afresh as it were from
the roots with greater promise of vigour and fruitsulnessff clariora is
held by some to mean ‘more brilliant.’ It would be possible to take
ab secunda orzjgine velut ab slitpibus closely together, but this seems to
involve considerable awkwardness.

§4- adminiculo] As Weissenborn remarks, this carries on the
image of the plant or trce. Trans. ‘prop,' or ‘support.'

Μ. Furio principe] M. Furius Camillus, with whose speech against
the proposed migration to Veii the F ifth Book had closed. Princeps is
an unofficial title, and means ‘foremost citizen! Augustus made a
dexter-ons use ot the word in founding his system of government.

anuo] i.e. Camillus, after celebrating his triumph, remained dictator
till the end of June, when he quitted office with the consular tribunes.
