114 LIVY. Vl. [xxn§7

usual in a pica os ill-healxhff furare in verba is the regular phrase sor
swearing according to a sixed form os words3 cl. Hor. Epist. 1. 1. 14:
iurare z'n verba magistri, ‘to take the oath imposed by the trainer on
the gladiator.² Excustzudae valeludinz' is dat. aster solita.

vegetum, etc.] Notiee the v alliteration. The Romans seem to
have been very fond of it3 cf. Lucr. 5. 993: viva videns vivo sepeliri
viscera buslo, and Cic. pro Mil. 11. 30: vi victa vis.

23 civiles...exeitabant] ‘wass would rouse him, though by this time he
did not take much share in politics.'

24 ξ 8. quaternum millium] Apparently only in round numbers3
there were usually 4200 men in a legion.

25 ad portam Esquilinam] This was E. of the city, and from it
branched the roads to Tibur (E.) and Praeneste (S.E.). As Satricum
lay S. of the city, in the Pomptine district, the Porta Capena would
have been, one would think, a more natural place of meeting. See
maps.

:S ᾖ· 9. praestabant] Praestare, meaning ‘to excel‚' is derived from
prae and stare; it is a different word from praestare, meaning ‘to make
good‚' which comes from praes slare‚ ‘to stand as su1·ety’; cf. Pros.
Conway’s edition of Bk 11, c. 18. 1111.

3) dilaturi] This use os the sut. part. to express intention is rare iu
strictly classica] prose, but becomes common in Livy ; cs. 8. 29. 12:
ut ‚refugerent hostes,...situ urbium moenibusque se defensuri. Perhaps
it is an imitation of the Greek use of the fut. part. Trans. ‘resolved to
make no delay in putting their all to the hazard.’

CHAPTER XXIII.

p. 32. 1 ἓ 1. praesentis dimicationis fortunam] ‘the hazard attend-
ing an immediate combat’; cs. 22. 12. 10 (of Fabius Cunctator): neque
universo periculo summa rerum committebatur. The characters of
M. Furius and L. Furius are very like those of Fabius and Minucius
respectively‚ though in a speech Minucius is made to contrast the
apathy of F abins—laic novus Camillus—with the energy displayed by
Camillus against the Gauls (22. 14. 9).

3 qul occasionem...qua0rebat] ‘who was seeking an opportunity of
assisting his resourees by strategy in prolonging the war.'
6 §2- expncare] ‘deploy.’

10 ἓ 3. ex incertissimo] ‘ from the most unreliable sources.' For the

superlative of the adj. used as subst„ cf. 1. 9. 3: ex in cmo nasci.
