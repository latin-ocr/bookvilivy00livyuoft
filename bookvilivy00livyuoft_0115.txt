.¹V ξ 7] NO'I'ES. 73

9 §4- ea. bella] 'l'he wars of 396, 395 huc. described in Book v, as
well as those mentioned in cc. 2, 3. This notice is no doubt to be
brought into connection with the creation of the four new tribes (c. 5. 8).
It is therefore impossible to believe that the citizenship was given only
to a sew deserters to the Roman cause3 it must have been bestowed upon
practically all the membcrs of the three communities mentioned.

¹4 ἓ 6. capitansque poena] Caput was used technically to denote the
sum of the rights possessed by a Roman citizen. A capitalis poena
might affect one or all of these rights. Here the punishment threatened
was probably the loss of all active citizen rights, but not the loss oi
personal freedom.

qu1]=ei qui. The subj. rengv'asset is due to or. obliqua. The
form of the direct would be: is, qui non remegraverit Romam, capitalem
poenam dobin cf. Hor. Od. 1. 10: te, boves olim nisi reddidisses l per
dolum amotas, puerum minaci Ι voce dum terret.

15 ex ferocibus...0bedientes] ‘ He reduced them from united defiance
to individual obediencess With this use of ex, denoting the passing from
one condition to another, cf. Gk ἐκ in phrases like τυφλὸς ἐκ δεδορκὸτος,
and καὶ λευκὸν ἦμαρ νυκτὸς ἐκ μελαγχίμου. Livy is very fond of contrast-
ing singuli and universi 3 cf. c. 18. 6, 7.

16 ἓ 6. cuin...tum] ‘ both...and also.’

¹7 re publica impensas adiuvante] Cf. 5. 55. 3, where we are told
that the state provided tiles free of eost and gave special facilities for
quarrying stone.

ι8 aedilibus velut publicum exigentibus opus] ‘the aediles inspecting
the work as though it were public'; cf. the phrase sarta lecta exigere,
which is used of censors, and means ‘to inspect (and pass) work let out
to contract) Exzssgere might here mean ‘to make compulsory.’ The
duty of letting out public works to contract lay with the censors, but
the aediles exercised a general supervision over the streets and public
buildings 3 in this case private buildings, as assecting public interests, fell
under their charge.

¹9 usus] Gen. ‘of using them‚’ i.e. the buildings3 admonebat is
absolute.

30 ἓ 7. Fidenas] Cognomina arose as a rule from some persona]
peculiarity or some accidental circumstance3 cf. Rufus, Cursor (9. 16. 13),
etc. The cognomen came into general use much later than the prae-
nomen and nomen; it will be noticed that many of the consular tribunes
mentioned in this book are without it. As time went on, however, the
use of the cognomen became almost a necessity, in order to distinguish
