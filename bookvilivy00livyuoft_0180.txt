emendation capsi et stzzpsntes, animis a voce alienis, *with minsls at

domi] η’. by the patriCIans. They had been caresully schooled in
private.

p, 50. 3 ξ 9. universa] Empliatic: ‘the plebs in unclivided body.’
6 ξ 10. tractandi] Eest taken with artifices: ‘experts at managing.’
8 §11- bina iugera] This argument which Livy puts into the

mouths of the tribunes and Fabius is quite sophistical, inasmuch as no
real comparison could be instituted between the small allotments of
arable land and the large tracts of ager occupalorz'us, which were as a
rule only suitable sor pasturage3 cf. c. 16. 6n. Moreover, whereas the
allotlnents granted to colonists were held in sull ownership, the pasture
lands always belonged, in theory at least, to the State.

9 quingenta] We might have expected the distributive quingena
corresponding to bina. But as in c. 37. 6 (see n. there) Livy prefers to
vary his expressions.

12 locum sepulturae] The rich had private tombs either within the
precincts of their villas 01· along the sides of the highways. Artisans,
slaves, and the poorer classes generally were buried in public cemeteries,
such as the notorious one on the Esquiline, which was obliterated by
Maecenas. The horrors of these public cemeteries, as described by
Prof. Lanciani (A ncz'ent Rome in llze light of recent dzkcoveries,
pp. 64 ff.)‚ lend special point to this passage.

ξ 12. an placeret] This represents an placet (vobi-cst of the recta.
It is virtually a rhetorical question, but being equivalent to a question
put in the znd person, is represented by the subj. in the oblique. For
the use of an in questions where a neg. answer is expected, see c. 7. 5 n. ;

“ ,ν,ψιιιἶ placeret=‘could it be that they thought it right?' i-e. ‘surely they
did not think it right!

13 potius quam] See c. ¹5- 12 n.

sorte] i.e. the prineipal alone, without addition os interest.

CHAPTER XXXVII.

ιδ ἓ 1. maiore...quam sua] This implies that Licinius and Sextius,
belonging as they did to the wealthy portion of the plebeians, had no
real interest in assisting the debtors, nay, they might even be acting
against their own interests in so doing. But they could not afford to
dispense with the aid of the poorer plebeians in their efforts to obtain the
consulship, and thus were forced to make this concession to them.
