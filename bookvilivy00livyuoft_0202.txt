§8. esse...pascantur] Mdg.; MSS. est...j›ascentur. Mdg. ob.
serves that, putting aside the awkwardness of the direct speech, we
should expect erit, not est, and that the use of the fut. and sut. perf. is
unintelligible, for the remark is a general one, and has no special
reference to the future.

nostri] Mdg.; MSS. vestri, which is not impossible.

42 ἓ 8. terrorque] MSS. Harant errarque3 Zingerle adopts this.
sese] Bracketed after Crevier. Others bracket se aftersuga.

ἓ 11. tandem] A. Perizonius. But the tamen of the MSS. gives
sair sense.

ἓ 12. immortalium] After this word the MSS. have causa libenter

facturos, which Mdg. removed3 the words were clearly interpolated
from ἓ 1 3.
