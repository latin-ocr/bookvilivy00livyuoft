pede-s, etc„ we find Romanusz' Romans' (c. 31. 7) and many similar
usages.

11 largitore] Praetically equivalent to an adjective, ‘open-handed’;
ef. c. ιο. 6: victorem exercitum, ‘the victorious army.' The allusion is
to Camillus’ disposal of the booty taken at Veii.

η ἓ 18- fugientes] ‘ the fugitives.’ The free use of present participles
as substantives is a characteristic of Livy’s style3 cf. c. 2 5. 9 discentium,
c. 37. 1 audientium.

¹³ septuagesimo...anno] It seems impossible to make out why Livy
set the duration of the Volscian war at 70 years. There had been
perpetual forays between the Romans and the Volscians since the regal
period} cf. 1. 53. '2 ι Is (Tarquinius Superbus) primus Volscis bellum in
ducentos amplius post suam aetatem annos movit. Apparently Livy has
been betrayed into sels-contradiction by combining the accounts of
different annalists.

ad deditionemr..subeg1t] But we very soon find the Volscians in
arms again (c. 6. 4 etc.). It is, however, certain that the Volscians
really received crushing blows from Rome about this period. Thus
Diodorus Siculus, whose references to Roman history are probably based
on the older and more trustworthy annals, says: τὸν ἔμπροσθεν χρόνον
ἰσχυροὶ δοκοῦντες εἶναι, διὰ τὴν συμφορὰν ταύτην ἀσθενέστατοι τῶν
περιοικούντων ἐθνῶν ἐγενήθησαν (14. 117. 3): cs. Introd. ἓ 4. ⁴

¹5 ἓ 14. molientes] [Παϋνὶ is used in so many different ways, that it

is worth while to distinguish some of them. The primary notion in-
volved is that of effort. In Livy we find amongst others the following
uses of the word. (1) Absolute, ‘to put oneself in motion‚' ‘to depart,’
cf. 37. ιι. 12 (of' ships): dum moliuntur a terra. (2) ‘ To work on’ a
thing: so 28. 17. 15: ancoras moliri ‘to hoist anchor'; 9. 3. 3: montes
moliri sede sua, ‘to remove mountains from their seat'; c. 34. 5: rem
ingentem moliundi causa. (3) A more general sense ‘to undertake,' as
in the present case, ‘designing war.’ In c. 11. 8 meaning (2) is
extended iu a bold manner in molirifidcm--t‘ to attack or tamper with
credit.’

CHAPTER ΙΙΙ.

23 ἕ 1. ingruerat] Not used by Cicero or Caesar. The word
perhaps=inruere. Hence its meaning ‘to threaten‚' ‘to assail.’

ξ 2. Sutrium, socios] Livy writes socios in apposition to the word

‘ citizens¹ implied in the name of the town. A bold use os these sense-
