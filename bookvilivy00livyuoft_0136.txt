laid his hand upon him in token that hc claimed him as his own pro-
perty (cs. the story of Verginia in 3. 44. 6): this laying of the hand
upon the object to be transferred was also part of the procedure in the
ceremony of mancipatio, or the formal conveyance of property from one
party to another, cf. Gaius, 1. 119.

crudelitate feneratorum] T acitus (Ann. 6. 16) says: primo duo-

probably, no creditor was to charge more than ιο per cent. interest per
annum. This rate of interest would be high enough to cause a con-

copper and the scales? In the presence of at least five witnesses and
a man holding a pair of scales (libripens) the debtor pronounced a
prescribed formula, at the same time striking the scales with a piece
of copper. By so doing he symbolically paid his creditor and effected
his own release (see Gaius 3. 173, 174). The explanation of these
symbolic acts is simple. The striking of the scales with the piece of
copper represented the weighing out of the aes rude or uncoined copper,
which formed the earliest Roman currency. This ceremony was also
performed at the transference of particular classes of property known as
res mancipi, cf. Gaius 1. 119. See Metine, Ancz'ent Law¹⁵‚ pp. 204ff.
