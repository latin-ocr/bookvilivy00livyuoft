xr ξ 8] NOTES. 87

24 patres] Here=patricians. Livy’s use of the word is by no means
constant, and it is important to note three distinct meanings z (ι) as here
and in the next section patres=the patrician order as opposed to the
plebs. (2)=the Senate. (3) In patrum auctoritas and in a sew other
phrases the word probably denotes the patrician portion of the Senate.
See c. 4¹· 10 n.

²5 ξ 7. primus omnium] The reading of the MSS., primum omnium,
cannot be retained. It is not strictly accurate sor Livy to say that
Manlius was the first patrician who turned popularis. In 2. 8. r he
applies the term to Valerius Publicola, while Sp. Cassius was also a
patriciani. Manlius, however, answers more thoroughly to the idea os
the populares os the last centurIes of the Republic, professional agitators
who strove to raise themselves to power by working upon the ignorance
and passions of the lower orders. No doubt Livy had the character of
these later agitators in mind, while writing the story of Manlius. See
Appendix.

28 aura] sc. populari; cf. Verg. Aen. 6. 816 nimium gaudens popula-
ribus auris. In 22. 26. 4 occurs the fuller phrase, aura fizvoris
populan's.

famaeque magnae] Gen. of quality or description. Cf. c. 22. 7:

exactae iam aetatis Camillus erat.

29 ξ 8. agrariis leg-ibus] Not that Manlius had actually introduced
any agrarian proposals. These were dangerous enough in the hands os
the tribunes of the plebs (another anticipation of the later times os the
Republic, particularly those os the Gracchi), but Manlius had gone
further and had attempted to overthrow credit, one os the bases upon
which society rested. Cf. c. 5. ι n.

30 fuisset] The subj. is to be explained as due to virtual or. ebliqua3
it expresses the thought in Manlius’ mind: ‘agrarian laws have been
always the weapon of mere tribunes of the plebs ; Ι, a patrician, must go
surther.'

fidem moliri] ‘to tamper with credit': sec c. 2. 1411.

31 aeris alieni stimulos] The early Roman law of debt wasmf a
peculiarly harsh character, and pressed very hardly upon the poorer
plebeians, who were continually being compelled to borrow. By the

law of the XII Tables (Gell. 20. 1. 45) debtors were allowed 30 days’
grace after the time sor payment became due ; they were then arrested

and sormally adjudged (addicti) by the praetor to the creditors, who
might keep them in bonds (vincito aut nervo aut compedibus quindecim
pondo, ne maiore, aut si volet minore vincito). This imprisonment lasted
