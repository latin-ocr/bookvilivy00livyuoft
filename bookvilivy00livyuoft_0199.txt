But Livy was so accustouied to the collocation Volsci el Acqm', that he
probably wrote it down here without thinking.

8 § 7. fugam impediebat] Edd. generally sor suga impediebat of the
best MSS. Some MSS. have suga impediebatur, which might be the
true reading.

9 ξό. in Volscos] A. Perizonius. MSS. in Volscis.

ἓ 9. tanta] MSS. 3 except M which has montana. Heerwagen
non lam a, adopted by XVeiss., Ltb., and Zingerle.

10 §8. iis] Wesenberg. MSS. his. Livy sometimes retains lu‘c in
or. obliqua, but in the present instance lzis would be especially awkward,
coming as it does immediately aster eos.

u ἓ 3. esse] Mdg. omits esse and reads apud exercilus tantum...

ἓ 7. primus] T. Faber. MSS. primum.

12 58. vatesque] The reading of the inferior MSS. The better
MSS. have vates-ve, which Weiss. retained, comparing c. ¹4· 10: iudi-
calum addictumve.

ἓ 10. tene ; at] Wesenberg. MSS. leneas, which XVeiss. retained,
comparing 3. 48. 4: ignosce...sim1s.

pavore] MSS. Mdg. labore on slight MS. authority.

1³ ξ 7. hommum] MSS. Siesbye omnium, which, as Ltb. says, gives
no intelligible constr. Wesenberg suggested nec hominum solum. nec
omnes would give a good sense, but would leave the origin of the cor-
ruption unexplained.

14 §2- intuenti] Gronovius. MSS. intuenda. which might aster all
be right.

ἓ 9- commodioris] Aldus. M SS. commotiores, which Weiss.
thought might bear an active meaning ‘more violent.’ Wesenberg
accommodanbris.

1⁵ §9- afluit] For the existence of this form, see Dombart. in Neue
Jahrbic'cherfiir Philologie, 1877, pp. 341 ff. No other example of the
meaning ‘to flow away srom’ is adduced from Classical Latinity; cf.
Gellius 5. 16. 3: Epicurus autem afluere semper ex omnibus emporibus
simulacra quaedam corporum zspsorum...putat. For the meaning ‘to be
present in abundance,’ several examplcs are cited, though there is usually
a discrepancy between the MSS. Cf. Livy 3. 26. 7: neque lzonori
magno locum neque vz'rluti putant esse, m'sz' ubi effcsae afluant opes (so
M. P¹ has afluent, other MSS. affluent); also 23· 4. 4: afluenti copia
voluptatium. See Fiigner‚ Lex. Liv„ s.v.

ξ 10. reliquam] Mdg. MSS. aliquam. Of other conjectures
Huschke’s at aequam and Morstadt’s antiquam may be mentioned.
