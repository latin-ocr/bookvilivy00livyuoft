P. 25. 6 §Q quot enim clientes...] The plebs is assumed to be
made up of clients. But this is, in all probability, only partially true.
The client, who was closely attached to some patrician house, was indeed
a plebeian; but besides the clients there must have been many other
plebeiam, e.g. Latin‘s who had settled in Rome for trade or other
purposes, and who were not bound to any patrician gens by the close
tie of clientship. Livy himself seems to recognize this in other
passages; cf. 5. 32. 8: dictamus, quae magna pars plebis crat.

As sor the reading, the quot enim of the MSS. may well be retained.
Livy says: ‘if you fought with equa} numbers you would win3 (much
more will you do so now)‚s0r you are greatly superior in numbers-³ Cs.
