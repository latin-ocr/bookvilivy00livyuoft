Thefastigrium is properly the triangular galile or pediment osa building,
hence ‘height‚' ‘summit’3 ef. ι. 38. 6, where sasltgrt'um=‘slope’; there
the sloping side of the pediment is thought of, here the apex. For the
expression, cf. Milton, Par. Lost 1. 24 f. :
‘That to the height of this great argument
1 may assert Eternal Providence.'

aequando] ‘equalling’ The word is in apposition to oratione.
This modal gerund is frequently used by Livy, and indeed by Latin
writers generally. Cf. 3. 53. 9: qui (tr-qno iure in cz‘vilate vivit nec
inserendo iniuriam nec patiendo, where we should translate simply
‘neither doing nor suffering wrong'3 cf. also c. 23. 4.

§ 9. capitolinam arcem] This seems to he a general expression
for the whole Mons Capitolinus. The two summm, Capitolium (S.W.)
and Arx (N.E.), are distinguished below; between these two summits
was the depression known as inter duos lucos. See rnap.

§ 10. in campo Martio] The regular place of meeting for the
Comitia Centuriam, which, as a military assembly, had to be convened
outside the pomerium. The previous proceedings had taken place at a
contio. Plutarch (Cam. 36) wrongly represents the trial as taking place
in the Forum (ἀγορά); εἰσαγομένων δὲ τῶν κατὰ τοῦ Μαλλίου δικῶν
μεγάλα τούξ κατηγόρους ἔβλαπτεν ὴ ὅψις“ ὁ ’γὰρ τόπος, ἐφ’ οὗ βεβηκὼς
ὁ Μάλλιος ἐνυκτομάχησε πρὸς τοὺς Κελτούς, ὑπερεφαίνετο τῆς ἀγορᾶς ἀπὸ
τοῦ Καπιτωλίου καὶ παρεῖχεν οἶκτον τοῖς ὁρῶσιν.

§ 11. prodicta die] ‘the day of trial having been adjourned! There
was no provision in law sor the adjournmeut (ampliatio) of trials before
the Comitia. But, as Prof. Mommsen points out, it would be easy sor
the presiding magistrate to break up the meeting under pretext of an
unsavourable omen, and to complete the trial 011 another day.

in Petelinum lucum extra portam Flumentanam] The Por ta Flu-
mentana was close to the river, in the low-lying ground by the Forum
Boariutn, s.W. of the Capitol; cf. 35. 9. 2 and 3. The lucus Pelelz'nus
(also mentioned in 7. 41. 3) must therefore have been situated just
outside this gate, on the river bank. But how in this case could the
people have avoided seeing the Capitol, which rose just above them?
The suggestion that the* trees of the wood shut out the view is not very
satisfactory. l'rof. Mommsen therefore conjectures that either (ι) the
position of the Porta Flumentana has been given wrongly (by Paulus,
an epitomator of Festus), or (2) the words extra partam Flumentanam
are a late addition, and that the lucus Pelclz'nus lay right the other side
os Rome, perhaps on the Esquiline. See map.
