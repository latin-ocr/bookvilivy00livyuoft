introduced by the magistrate sor acceptance or rejection by the
assembly.

legatus] This word inay well be retained in addition to orator3
stress is laid upon the fact that Fabius had fought while in the capacity
of envoy. Livy's style is sull, and he does not hesitate to use two words,
though only one is absolutely necessary. See Appendix.

orator] For the meaning ‘env0y,' cs. Verg. Aen. 7. 153: centum
oratores augusta ad moenia regis Ι ire iubet.

ius gentium] ‘The law of nations‚’ not ‘international law' in the
modern sense. The ius gentium was a body os rules generally ob-
scrvcd among the various peoples with whom the Romans were brought
in contact2 and was contrasted with the ius civile or laws specially
affecting Roman citizens. See hlaine, Ancient Law, ch. iii, and
cf. c. 17. 8n.

¹7 §8- Camillus] See Appendix.

18 creat] Livy never troubles to use very accurate terms in relation to
constitutional points. The interrex presided at the elections, took the
auspices, and dnly returned (renuntiare) the elected candidates. Hence
creat simply: ‘ obtains the election of.‘ ’

21 ἓ 9. magistratum inissent] The ordinary date upon which consuls
or consular tribunes entered office was at this period July rst3 but,
owing to the interregnum, the date on the present occasion must have
been July 6th or later. It may be noted in this connection that the
tribunes of the plebs always entered upon office on December ioth.

Ξ 3 ἓ 10. foedera] Treaties were reckoned under the head of religiones,
as being concluded with elaborate religious ceremonies. See especially
r. 24. 4, where the ceremvony at the conclusion of a treaty between the
Romans and Albans is fully described.

duodecim tabmae] The famous code of laws drawn up by the
decemviri ligibus scribundis in 451, 450 B.c. The original tables were
set up in the Forum; cf. 3. 57. 10: leges...in aes incisas in publico
proposuerunt. ·

24 regiae leges] Very little is known of these ‘royal laws‚' but it
seems probable that they were certain rules, partly os a secular, partly
of a religious character, which were published by the pontifices under
the Kings’ directions for the guidance of the public. The pontifical
rules were usually kept a close secret, and the present opportunity was
seized upon to suppress those relating to religion, which had previously
been published; these most likely concerned the calendar and festivals.
