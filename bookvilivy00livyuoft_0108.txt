66 LIVV. Vl. [1§12

litasset] litam· means ‘to offer a savourable sacrifice.' Cf. 5. 38. τ’,
nec auspsmto nec litato instruunt aciem. When the omens were un-
favourable, it was the duty of the general to endeavour by every means

in his power to avoid an engagement, until by renewal (instauratio) of ’

sacrifice savourable omens were obtained ; cs. 7. 8. 5: diu non perlitatum
tenuerat cla-latorem, ne autc meridiem signum dare posset. Cf. also
Gellius 5. 17. 2.

neque] = et non.

pace deum] ‘ the support‚' or ‘ favour of heaven.'

post. diem tertium] ‘two days afterwardsss as we should say. The
Romans included the day reckoned from in their calculation.

rebus divinis supersederi] ‘that public sacrifice should be resrained
from.' As a result no comilz'a could be held and no battle (at all events
in offence) could be fought, since a public sacrifice was a necessary
prelude to these. The days following the Kalends, Nones, and Ides,
are called by post-classical writers dies posu-[diam.
