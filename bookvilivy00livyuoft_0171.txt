xxxu ξ 3] ΝΟ 7735. 1 ²9

32 ln extrema finium] Neut. asli. used as subst. with gen. depending
on it. Livy is fond ot this constr., which is rarely found in prose before
him; cf. c. 32. 5: subita hell2'; 5. 29. 4: per aversa urln's; 9. 35. 7:
per obliqua campi, etc. Lucretius uses this constr. with great f1·eedom;
cf„ e.g., 1. 315: detrita viarum Ι saxea, and see Munro’s note3 cf. also
Verg. Aen. 1. 422: strata viarum. This is one of the cases where Livy
shows a liking for poetic diction.

Ron'aano] Contrast with Vola-is aliove, and see c. 2. 12 n.

p. 43. 1 hostico] Another adj. used as subst.; cf. the frequent
publicum sor publicum aerarium. The word hostscus is not found in
Cicero or Caesar, who use hostilis.

‘z §8- tectis agrorum] ‘country houses‚’ i.e. scattered villas as
opposed to villages.

3 satis] From sero: ‘crops.’

5 praeda] Is connected with prehendo, and means anything captured.
In ancient warfare homines were as much part of the booty as anything
else; they were sold into slave-ry, and the price formed part of the
manubiae.

CHAPTER XXXII.

7 ξ 1. postquam..,erant] ‘as soon as things began to be quiet.’

8 celebrari] ‘ became frequent.’

9 tantum abesse spem„ ut] This constr. is a simple variation of the
usual tantum abesse ut spes esset, ut.

10 tributo] Cf. c. 3¹· 4n.
fenus] We might rather have expected aes alienum. The interest

on the debt is put instead of the debt itself.
in murum] This is generally taken to refer to the serv-ian wall,

which may have suffered from the Gallie invasion. But it is strange
that the wall should have been allowed to remain unrepaired sor such a
long time3 its restoration would surely have been a matter os greater
importance than the sacing of the Capitol with hewn stone (e. 4. 12 n.).
Livy's language is vague‚ but seems rather to imply that the wall was an
entirely new one.

i 1 locatum] ‘let out to cono-aet) 'l‘he opposite is conducere, ‘ to take
a cont1·act.'

20 §8- coacta] sc. plebs. The plebeians were so deep in debt that
their only hope of getting merey from their patrician creditors lay in
propitiating thern by such a concession as this. Note the repetition
