authority, had made for itself certain inviolable rules.’ The sreedom of
the best period of the Republic was no ‘ Freedom sree to slay herself,
and dying while they shout her name.’ It is in passages like this that
the secret of Rome's greatness and of Livy's enduring worth comes out.

10 tribuni plebis] The tribunes of the plebs remained in office during
the dictatorship, but they could not hamper the dictator by interposing
their veto. Similarly there was no provocatio from the dictator's
sentence.

13 § 4. vestem mutasse] A common sign of anxiety on behalf of a
public favourite. Here the change of dress was voluntary, but mourning
was sometimes officially ordered, a rare and high compliment. Cf. Cic.
pro Planc. 3 5. 87: at erat mecum senatus el quidem vesle mutata, quod
pro me uno post hominum memoriam publico consilio susceptum est. The
mourning of the plebs was probably shown by the wearing of the toga
pulla and the disfiguring of themselves with dust and ashes ; cf. ἓ 8.

capillum ac barbam promisisse] The Romans of Livy’s day were
clean shaven, as may be seen from busts of the time of Augustus. This
fact, no doubt, has betrayed Livy into the present inaccuracy, for at the
time of which he is here writing beards were universal. In 5. 41. 9 he
says correctly : barbam...‚ ut tum omnibus promissa erat.

15 ξ 5. triumphavit] At first sight another inaccuracy on Livy's part.
The triumphator should not, according to the general rule, have entered
the city before his triumph, whereas Livy depicts him as takinga leading
part in the proceedings against Manlius. Cf. the case of Caesar in
00 B.C., who, as he had to enter the city to stand for the consulship, was
obliged to forego a triumph. Plut. Caes. 13: τοὺς μὲν μνωμένους θρίαμβον
ἔξω διατρίβειν ἔδει. But it may be that the dictator, as the embodiment
of martial law, was not bound by the rule which a consul was compelled
to obey.

invidiaeque] The -que is used adversatively=‘but.' Cf. c. 4. ιο
and c. 21. 9 : arguentibusque. Invidiae and gloriae are probably
‘ predicative’ datives, though it is barely possible that they are
genitives.

21 §6- Satricum] Cf. c. 7. 1 n. Livy in c. 22. 4 calls Satricum
coloniam populi Romani, but there is no reason t'o believe that the
colony was other than Latin. The colonising of the place was a measure
of desence‚ as well as an attempt to gain popular-ity.

ἠ iugera] The iugerum was about two-thirds of an English acre3 it
was originally the amount of land which could be ploughed in one day.
Cf. for the idea z. 10. 12 : agri qnantum uno die circumaravit datum-—
