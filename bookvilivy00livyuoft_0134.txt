92 LJVY. Vl. [xlll §3

Also Scott, lllamnion, vi. 26:
‘Thon mark'd they, dashing broad and sar,
The broken billows os the war.'
3 cernebat] ‘ As soon as each began to see '3 cf. c. ιο. 4 n.
4 ξ 4. conferti] From conscrcz'o: ‘in compact order.’
6 equitum turmae] Three hundred cavalry were attached. to each
legion, and were divided into ten lamnae of thirty men.
7 signo] This time with the trumpet, not with the flag, since the
signal had to be distinguished in the confusion of battle.

ι) ἓ 5. obequitando] Not found before Livy: ‘ by riding close up.’
10 iusta caede] ‘with a thorough slaughter.' Cf. iustus exercitus, ⁸ a
regular army’ (c. 31. 6), iusta obsidio (10. 45. 13), z'nsla victoria, etc.

13 ξ 6. praeda] The Roman general had absolute power to dispose
of booty taken in war, provided that he devoted it to a purpose other
than personal. Thus he could, as here, distribute it among the soldiers,
or he could pay it into the aerarium, or else devote it to the service of
some god. Note the distinction between praeda, the actual booty taken,
and vezozabiae, the money realized by the sale of booty. Cf. Gell. 13.
24· ‘z 5: praeda dicitur corpora ipsa rerum, quae capta sunt: manubiae
vero appellatae sunt pecunia a quaestore ex venditione praedae redacta.

¹5 ξ ’1. hominum] This, the reading of the MSS„ is certainly better
than the proposed emendation omnium. We must consider that Livy
has varied his constr„ as he does so osten. First he has used suit with
exz‘consistcd of‚’ and then with the gen. hominum with the same
meaning. ‘The greater part of the captives consisted of H. and L.‚
and not (i.e. merely) of men drawn from the plebs.' If a change
were thought necessary, nec omncs sor nec hominnm might be suggested.
See Appendix.

militasse] sc. eos. Mercede: ⁴ for 1·ewa1·d,’ the so-called abl. of price,
which is really instrumental: ‘ had taken service by (inducement of) pay.’

16 fides] ‘proofi’ Cf. Gk πίστις, which means either confidence in a
thing or that which gives confidence—zr proof.

20 ξ 8. quisque] Inserted in apposition to omnem cf. c. 15. 3, c. ²5· 9.
The words defectionem sui quisque populi form a parenthesis, not
affecting the constr. of the sentence; cf. 2. 38. 6: domos inde dtgressi
sunt, instigandoque suos quisque populos qffccere, ut....
