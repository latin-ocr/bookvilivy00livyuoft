the reward of Horatius, which would of course be equivalent to several
iugera, though Macaulay’s estiinate would set it down at one :—
‘They gave him of the corn-land
That was of public right
As much as two strong oxen
Could plough from morn till night!
See also Frazer’s note on βουλυτὸς in class. Rev. 2, pp. 260, 261, where
it is shown that in ancient times ploughing probably ceased soon after
midday. The amount of land assigned seems to have varied from two
iugera (4. 47. 6) to seven (granted at Veii, 5. 30. ὃ).

misery.

CHAPTER XVII.

p- 23. -4 §L itaque] For position, see c. 4. 8n.

7 ξ 2. Sp. cassium] Cf. 2. 4¹· 1. In 486 15.C. Spurius Cassius,
when consul, concluded the treaty with the Hernici, and afterwards
proposed an agrarian law, the chief feature of which was the granting of
a share in the distribution to the Latins. He was suspected of aiming
at regal power, and was condemned to death. As in the stories
of Sp. Maelius and M. Manlius, so in the account of Cassius many
features have been introduced, which properly belong to the later
agrarian struggles.

8 Sp. Maelium] Cf. xv. ¹3 and 14. In 439 B.C. Sp. Maelius, a
wealthy knight, sold corn to the people at a very low price. This
brought upon him suspicion of aiming at a tyranny, and he was
inurdered by the Master of the Horse, C. Servilius Ahala. We have
here, perhaps, some confusion with the story of [he Gracchi.

11 § 3. saginare] Properly used of sattening animals. The people
‘fatten up' their leaders, only to let them be killed. Tacitus (llist.
2. 88) has gladiatoriam saginam, a special food for gladiators.

[populares] suos] The two words together would naturally mean
‘their own countrymen.’ Hence Madvig bracketed populares as a gloss
upon suos, ‘their champions.' See Appendix.

η hocine] See c. 16. 2n. Translate: ‘ought this to have been the
fate of a man of consular rank for not replying at the dictator⁷s beck ?’
Or. recta: lwcine patiendum fuit. si non respondit? Hoc is used
(instead of illud) for the sake of vividness.
