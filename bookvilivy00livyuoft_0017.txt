INTRODUCTJON. 3¹ 1. xi

contra nomen Romanum gloriae fizvent. Is it likely that he
would have refrained from alluding to the restoration (in 20 ΒΕ.)
of the standards captured by the Parthians at Carrhae, if he had
been writing at a time subsequent to that date? We are there-
fore justified in concluding that book vl was written between
27 and 20 nc.

§2 LIVY AS HISTORIAN.

Before we pass to the consideration of some of the most
prominent characteristics of Livy as a historiari, it will be well
to take a glance at the conception of historical writing which
prevailed in the Roman world at, or shortly after, the period
in which he lived. It was very different from that of our
day. We hear little or nothing about the sifting of sources,
the evidence of archaeology‚ or the scientific method of re-
seaoeh, but much, on the contrary, about the relations of history
to rhetoric and poetry‚ and of the opportunities it affords for
the display of style. Take for example the words of Cicero
(De leg. 1. 2. 5): poles autem lu profecto satis facere in ea
(sc. historia), quippe cum sit opus, ut tibi quidem videri solet,
unum lzoc oratorium maxime,· or again those of Quintilian
(10. 1. 31), which, it may be sasely assumed, express an opinion
that had prevailed in Livy’s day also: historia quoque alere
oratorem quodam uberi iucundoque sirco potest...est enim
proxima poetis et quodam modo carmen solutum. Finally,
there is the evidence of Livy himself (Pref. ἕ 2): novi semper
scriptores aut in rebus certius aliquid allaturos se aut scribendi
arte rudem vetustatem superaturos credunt. With this view of
the character of history, as the Romans conceived it, before us,
we are in a better position to appreciate some of the more
striking features os Livy's method of historical writing.

Lz'vy's authorities and lais nse of them. In this book (c. 1)
something is said about the sources from which the historian of
early Rome could draw his information. Most characteristically
Livy remarks (ἓ 2) that the only faithful guardians of the memory
of past actions are literary documents, and that these for the
most part perished in the burning of Rome hythe Gauls.
