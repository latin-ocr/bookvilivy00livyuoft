148 LIVV. Vl. [xm §1

meaning is: ‘the plebeiam, is this law is passed, are sure of the highest
office in the state; consequently they will not feel as much gratitude sor
this greatest of gists‚ as they would sor the smallest‚ is they were com-
pelled to sue for it.' The sentence is an amplification of c. 40. 20.
Pro means ‘in proportion t0‚’ as in such phrases as 21. 29. 2: proelium
atrocius quam pro numero pugnantium editur. For another passage,
where a fondness sor vei-bal contrast has resulted in obscurity‚ see 22. 38.
11: se, quae consilia magis res deut hominibus quam homes rebus,
ca ante tempus immatura non praecepturum. The words quam homines
rebus, if taken strictly, have no meaning.

16 occasionibus] ‘ by watching their opportunities‚’ i.e. by waiting till
no other plebeian candidate comes foi-ward, and so securing their
election without contest. ’

¹7 ἓ 2. est aliquis] ‘there is sure to be someone.’

22 53. tanquam reg-um in capitolio] Cf. c. 40. ro, above: Tar-
quinii tribum· plebis, and ἓ 10, below. References are found elsewhere
to these statues of the Kings set up on the Capit013 cf. Appian B. C.
1. 16 (of the death of Tib. Gracchus): Γράκχος αὐτός, εἱλούμενος περὶ τὸ
ἱερόν (i.e. the temple os Jupiter), ἀνῃρέθη κατὰ τὰς θύρας, παρὰ τοὺς τῶν
βασιλέων ἀνδριάντας. The reference, however, to these statues as existing
at this period is an anachronism.

26 erit] See Appendix.

27 §.Q etenim] This, the reading of the MSS„ may well be retained.
Appius apologizes for dwelling so long on points which merely affect
the dignity os a class os men. Etenim explains satis: ‘I have said
enough and to spate on this point, for it is one c«›ncerning mere human
dignity.’ Madvig's alteration to at enim gives, os course, good sense,
but does not seem necessary. s

30 auspiciis...ig·noret 2²] Cf. c. 2. 5 n. and Val. Max. 2. 1. 1 : apud antl-
quos non solum publice sed etiam privatim m'lzt'l gerebatur nisi auspicio
primo sumpto ; also Cic. in Vol. 6. 14: auspicia, quibus llaec urbs con-
dita cst, quibus omnis res . publica atque imperium continetur.

33 ἓ 5. patres] Here unmistakably means ‘patricians.’

plebeius...magistratus] The tribunes of the plebs and the plebeian
aediles, being without the right of taking the auspices, were not elected
under the presidency of a magistrate einpowered to take the auspices;
cf. 5. 14. 4: comitiis, auspicato quae fierent, indtgnum dis visum
honores vulgari discriminaque §ulium cotfimdi; cs. also 4. 6. 2.

P· 58ι 2⁷ §6- populus] The whole people in the comitia as con-
trasted with the ,Νι-[ις in its concilia.
