senior consul being said fasces habere (cf. 2. r. 8 and 3. 36. 4); each,

the field together, this right of intercessio ceased, so that a consul had
no legal check wbatsoever upon his colleague (non posse impedire). As
a matter os fact some agreement was usually arrived at, whereby the
one consul x'oluntarily placed himself in a subordinate position (cf.
