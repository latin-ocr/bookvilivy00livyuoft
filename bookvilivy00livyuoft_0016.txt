part os his life in Rome (for there is much to show that he knew
the city well), busily engaged on his mighty work, but towards
the close returned to his native Patavium once more, where, as
Jeromc tells us, he died in 17 A. D.

Livy’s history extended from the earliest times down to the
death of Drusus, the younger son of the Empress Livia, which
took place in 9 Β. C. There were no fewer than 142 books, 35 of
which have come down to us, the rest having been lost in the
Middle Ages. Summaries (Periochae) of the contents of the
books, drawn up about the fourth century, offer a very in-
adequate substitute for the lost parts of the work (cf. the
Periocha placed at the end of the text of this book). After the
death of Augustus in 14 A. D. it is only natural that Livy should
have desired to carry his history on to that date, in which case
the books would probably have reached the round number
of 15o; but if this were his purpose, it was frustrated by death.

To determine the dates of the composition of the various
parts of the history the evidence of the books themselves must
be relied on. They were certainly published in sections, each
of which was probably distinguished by a certain unity of
subject. The opening words of the present book seem to
suggest that books 1-—v were published together, and that
book V1 is the beginning of a fresh section of the work3 it
must be borne in mind that the division into decads is arbitrary
and of comparatively late date. From various indications it
may be concluded that the first nine books were written between
27 and 20 Β. C. Thus in 1. 19. 3 Octavianus is called by his title
of Augustus, which was not conferred upon him till 27 B. C. In
the same passage reference is made to the closing of the temple
os Janus for the third time in Roman history. Now we know
that the temple of Janus was closed for the fourth time in 25 B.C.,
so the conclusion is that the first book was written between 27

and 25 Β.(,“. Ι11 IX. 18, where Livy is discussing the chances ‚

Rome would have had in a conflict with Alexander the Great,
he alludes incidentally to the rivalry between Rome and Parthia,
and talks of certain levissimi ex Graecis, qm' Parthorum quoque
