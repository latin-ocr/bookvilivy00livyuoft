1 §61 NOTES 6 3

The ‘year' meant is that of the magistrates. No dictator could lawfully
remain in office beyond a period of six inonths3 he usually resigned
immediately after his special task had been carried out3 cf. c. ²9· 10 (os
T. Quinctius Cincinnatus) ι die vicesimo, quam crectlus erat, dictatura se
abdicavit. Plutarch (Cam. 3¹) is wrong in saying that Camillus remained
dictator for a whole year: ὴ βουλὴ τὸν Κάμιλλον οὑκ εἴασε βουλόμενον
ἀποθέσθαι τὴν ἀρχὴν ἐντὸς ἐνιαυτοῦ, καίπερ ἐξ ,ιιῆνας οὐδενὸς ι’]περβοιλὸντος4
ἐτέρου δικτάτορος.

ξε. tribunos] Owing to the disaster which had happened during

their term of office the consular tribunes were held vilio creali, i.e. it was
supposed that there must have been some ssaw in the taking of the
auspices at the time of their electiori. They were therefore called upon
to resign‚ as being incapable of presiding at the* election of their
successors and os taking the auspices3 cf. 8. 3. 4. The dictator, as
nominated by·0ne of these consular tribunes, would be considered
equally incapable of holding the elections.
2. 1. res ad interregnum rediit] Upon the resignation of the
consuls or consular tribunes the government passed temporarily into
the hands of the patrician portion of the Senate (patres). In the regal
period this had been the case upon the death of the King. This state
of affairs was known as an zbeMrregnuaen. The patriciam portion of the
senate then nominated from their number an inlerrex (interregem prodere),
who held office for five days; it should be noted that the first interrex
never held the elections, probably because he had not received office
directly from the hands of a magistrate. He nominated a second
interrex, who, if the omens were favourable, could hold the electioris.
But there was nothing to prevent the succession cf any number os
huet-reges, should circumstances so require.

ἓ 6. opere ac labore] Cf. ἕ 3: laelius feraciusque. A certain
amount of tautology is characteristic of Livy's style. Cf. Intrud. ἓ 3.

Q. Fabio] Cf. 5. 36. 7. Fabius, though ambassador, had assisted
the people of Clusium in battle against the Gauls.

simul primum] So frequently in Livy for simulac primum.

(ueta tues est] In the case of trials before the Comitia (iudicia
populi), the prosecutor, who was necessarily a magistrate,'gave formal
notice in a contio or mass-meeting ot‘ his intention to summon the
accused sor enquiry on a certain day. Hence diem dicere=‘to give
formal notice of a prosecution.’ The preliminary enquiry (anqm'sitio)
led up to the trial proper before the Comitia Centuriata or Tributa,
which took the form of a rogalio or bill of pains and penalties
