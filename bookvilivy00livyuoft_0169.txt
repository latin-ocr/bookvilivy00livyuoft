xxx ὃ 9] NOJ'ES. 1 27

τ. 450: aeraque quae claustris restantia vorfferantur, ‘the bolts which cry
out as they chare against the staples.7 Cf. also Tac. Anu. 3. 46. 6:
paulum morae attulere ji'rmlc' restantibus lamminis adversum pila et
gladios.

caedunt caedunturque] Perhaps modelled on Verg. Aen. 10. 756:
caedebant pariter pariterque ruebant Ι victores victique. It seems certain
that Livy was well acquainted with the Aeueid before its actual publica-
tion in 19 13.c. See Introd. §3.

21 ἓ 6. fortunae] It is impossible to decide (logmatically whether
this is gen. or dat. Either ‘what little of the Roman people’s good
fortune yet remained' or ‘whatsoever was yet lest to the fortune of the
Roman people ' makes good sense.

²4 §¹7. postquam ..afferebantur et apparust] ‘when reports as to
the tranquillity of affairs among the Volsci kept coming in and it hemme
evident.’ Note the change of tense, and cf. c. 10. 4n. and 2. 6. 3.

26 §8. inde...inde] The repetition seems awkward to us, but cf. c.
28. 6n. The first inde probably refers to place, the second to time3 if
both are taken as referring to place, the repetition is less tolerable.

27 quantum a. Volscis] ‘as far as could be expected from the Volscians.’
This seems preferable to the translation ‘as sar as the Volscians were
concerned,' in which case the Volscians are contrasted with the Latius.
The point is that the Volscians heneesorth ceased to be dangerous, but
did not altogether cease from making their accustomed inroads3 we
sind them renewing their attacks next year (e. 31. 3).

28 tumultuatum] sc. est. Tumulluari is a deponent vb, meaning ⁸ to
make a disturbance! The passive sense is only found impersonally3
cf. Caes. B. G. 7. 61 : hostibus nuntiatur in castris Romanorum praeter
consuetudinem tumultuari, ‘that there was an unusual (listurbance.'

29 ξ 9. Setiam] A Latin colony, situated on the ssank of the Volscian
hills just above the Pomptine marshes. See map. Ceaseless struggles
with the Volscians had no doubt depleted its population since the time
it was founded, about 382 ΒΕ. ; cf. Vell. Pat. 1. 14: post septem annos
quam Galli urbem ceperunt, Sutrium deducta colonia cst,· cl post annum
Setina (i.e. Setia),· novemque interiectis anuis Msse.

ipsis] Cf. c. 3. 2n.

3¹ tribunorum multum ex plebe] To be taken closely together: ‘of

the plebeian military tribunes.'
