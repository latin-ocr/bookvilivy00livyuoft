CHAPTER XXXI. ’

p. 42. 12 ἓ 2. culus noscendi causa] Cf. c. ²7· 3: censoribus quoque
egui! (mnus, maxime propter incertam famam aeris alieni.

14 bello impediti sunt] Each paterfattzz‘lz'as and each person sui iuris
was required to make a personal statement as to the amount of his
property before the censors in the Campus Martius. It is obvious that ,
war would keep many from attending, and so render a postponement os
the census necessary.

ἕθ. fuga] :fugientes in sense. For the personification of the
abstract noun, cf. c. 3²· 10: plus tamen timor quam ira celeritatis
habuit. Cf. also 8. 19. 9: turba extremae fugae.

18 ξ 4. contra] ‘ on the contrary,’ as'often.

20 debellatum] See Appendix.

tributum] This was a special war tax, the proceeds of which could
be devoted to any military purpose (cf. c. 32· 1); it was imposed
upon each Roman citizen, and was proportioned to the amount of
property possessed by any individual and registered in the tabulae
censoriae. The actual sum raised varied according to the needs of the
treasury. Theoretically the tax was regarded as a loan, to be repaid at
the earliest opportunity3 but it appears to have been levied annually
from the time that regular pay was given to the Roman soldier (406 B.C.)
up to 167 B.C., when the wealth which flowed in from the provinces
enabled the state to take the burden of the tm'bulum off Roman
citizens.

21 diceret] Madvig's alteration to diceretur is unnecessary. Strietly
speaking, no doubt, quis should apply to the same person in both
parts os the sentence; but surely this is a case in which the reader's
intelligence could not sail to supply the right meaning. See Ap-
pendix.

²4 §6. dextrorsus] ‘towards the right‘: compounded of dexter and
vorsus.

in] See Appendix. ρ

26 Ecessram] Ace. of motion to a town, here without the ad which
Livy often inserts. The place was situated E. among the Volscian
mountains. See map.

28 ἓ 6. discordiae] For the dat. after fretus, see c. 13. 1 n.

²⁴) iusto...iusta] The first means ‘ regular’ (cf. c. 13. 5 n.)‚ the second
probably combines the ideas of ‘ thorough ² and ‘ righteous.’

50 ἓ ¹7. quippe] Explanatory: ‘the fact was that)
