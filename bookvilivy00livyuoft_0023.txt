this last being, perhaps, an imitation of a Greek construction.
Yet these small points and others like thern detract but little
from the conspicuous merits of Livy's language3 they cannot
obscure its richness, its clearness‚ its variety, which avoids
monotony even where the material is most unpromising, and
its glowing beauty, whenever the subject is one calculated to
arouse animation. Particular instances of construction or
phrase peculiar to Livy are commented upon in the notes as
they occur, but it may be useful to illustrate certain features of
his style by examples brought together from book VI.

Riclmess and suiness. These qualities are alluded to by
Quintilian (10. 1. 32) in the words ‘illa Livi lactea ubertas' and
are contrasted with the brevitas of Sallust. The present book
furnishes ample illustration of this feature of Livy’s style, not
merely in such phrases as opere ac labore (c. 1. 6), luctum
lacrimasque (c. 3. 4), neque nego neque infitias eo (c. 40. 4),
etc„ but more particularly in passages of vivid narration, such
as the entire story of Manlius or the picture of peaceful life at
Tusculum (c. 25), where the historian gives full play to his great
descriptive powers. Such fulness is at times apt to degenerate
into tautology and verbosity, defects which ancient critics were
not slow to note in Livy's style. Quintilian (8. 3. 53) speaks of
the μακρολογία of Livy, and cites in illustration a passage which
shows that words unnecessary to the sense should not always
be expunged as glosses: vitanda μακρολογία, id est longior quam
oportet sermo; ut apud T. Livium, Legati non impetrata pace
, retro domum, unde venerant, abierunt (cf. in this book c. 6. ς :
quod non prohibitos tantum modo voluntarios dicerent militare,
ubi vellent). These occasional defects served to give point to
the sweeping criticism of the Emperor Caligula: ut verbosum
in historia negligentemque (sc. Livium) cm‘pcbat (Suet. C al. 34).

Leaning towards rhetoric. That Livy was interested in
rhetoric we know from other sources besides the internal evidence
of his history. Thus the elder Seneca records the following
criticism: Livius de oratoribus qui verba antiqua et sordida
consectantur—b}fratione} obscuritatem severitatem putant, ‘E'fffllss
Miltiadem rhetorem eleganter clim'ssese’vrl τὸ λεξικὸν μαίνονται
(Controv. ΙΧ. 25. 26). With this may be compared his advice to
