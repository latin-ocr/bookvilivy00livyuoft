and 6 he says that the majority of the authorities are against
Claudius with regard to the (late of the battle fought with the
Gauls on the river Anio, and he at once decides to follow the
majority, without apparently taking quality into consideration.
Yet even so he makes a mistake. After stating that the maj0rity
put the date of the battle at least ten years later, in vu. 9 and 10
he gives an account of the fight under the year 361 B.c., or only
six years later than the date assigned by Claudius. Other in-
stances os carelessness, particularly in respect of constitutional
details, will be pointed out in the notes.

All this, however, merely indicates that Livy shared the
views of his age with regard to history, and that he did not
consider that deep and searching criticism was necessary. It is
far more instructive to turn to the positive side, and to look at the
merits which stand forth so conspicuously in Livy as a historian.

His candour. First and foremost comes his candour, his
earnest desire to be fair. It is very important not to con·-
found want of criticism with want of truth, for Livy, though
constantly erring from a neglect of historical research, never, so
sar as we can judge,deliberate1y violates the truth. His example
in this respect was rendered the more valuable by the fact that
many of his predecessors in the field of history had been by no
’ means equally scrupulous. The candour of Livy was, together
with his eloquence, the quality which particularly impressed his
Roman readers. Quintilian writes of him : nec indzjgnelur sibi
Herodotus aequari Titum Livium, cum in narrando mirae
iucunditate clarissimique candoris (this refers, probably, to
both purity of style and straightforwardness of character), lum
in contionibus supra quam enarrari polest eloquentem (10. 1. 101).
In the judgment of the elder Seneca (Suus. 6. 22) he is natura
candidissimus omnium magnorum ingeniorum, aestimator.
Tacitus (Anu. 4. 34) remarks that he is eloquentiae ac fidei
praeclarus in primis. Some evidence in support of these judg-
ments can be found in the present book. There is, for example,
no mistaking the fact that Livy's sympathies are in the main
with the patricians and against the plebeians ; yet this does not
blind his eyes to the fact that the miseries of the plebs are real
and that the patricians are overhearing and oppressive (cf.
