c. 34. 1, where the vis patrum is spoken os, and c. 32. 3, an
exposure os patrician malpractices at the elec-lions). Again, the
fairness os the writer, who thoroughly detests Manlius’ conduct,
is shown uninistakably by the way in which he mentions the
points in his favour, viz. the absence of any positive act of
treason and the glorious array of noble deeds done in behalf os
his country. Even the passages cited above as showing Livy's
lack of criticism are sometimes evidence of his desire for truth ;
he wants to know why the Volscians never failed to raise an
army, he does not conceal the fact that accounts as to the trial of
Manlius differ, and that the battle with the Gauls cannot with
certainty be assigned to a particular date.

His moral earnestness. Livy's emphatic opinion is that the
chief purpose of history is a moral one. This he indicates with
great clearness in his presace (ᾖ 10) : lzoc illud est praecipue in f
cognitione rerum salubre ac srugistrum omnis te exempli docu- j
·menta in inlustri posita monumento intueri; inde tibi tuaeque}
reipublicae quod imitere capias, inde foedum inceptu, foedum}
exitu, quod vites. Nor is it altogether certain that this view os
Livy as to the main function of history was a wrong one. It is
indeed not unfortunate for us that he had this aim before him,
the aim of drawing noble lessons from the noble lives of the
heroes of the Republic, rather than that of proving that a large
part of the so-ealled history of Rome was nothing but a
fabrication.

The present2book is not wanting in instances of this moral
eamestness. Ih the downfall of Manlius he sees the downfall
of immoderate ambition, which blots out the memory of many
p st services to the state: illud notandum vedetur, ut sciant

mines, quae et quanta decora foeda cupiditas regni non
ingrata solum, sed invisa etiam reddiderit. Very striking is the
way in which he brings out the moral strength of the Roman
plebs, which prevents it breaking the law in order to rescue its
favourite Manlius aster the dictator's judgment: sed invicta sibi
quaedam patientissima iusti imperii civitas fecerat, nec adversus
dictatoriam vim aut tribuni plebis aut {osa plebs attollere oculos
aut hiscere audebant. Note too the way in which he dwells
lovingly upon the character of Rome’s great heroes, how loath
