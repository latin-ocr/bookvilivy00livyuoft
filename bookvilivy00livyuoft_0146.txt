104 LlVls. Vl. [xviii ξ 9

16 ἓθ. abominamini] ‘express abhorre-nce) The words are half
ironical. ‘⁴ You do well to express abhorrence (and say) ‘ Heaven will
avert this.‘’' Pious wishes without works will do little.

ιδ dent...oportet] Dent is a jussive subj. and might well stand alone
without oportet. Itis not necessary to suppose that there is an ellipse
of ut3 oportet is almost parenthetical. Cf. 22. 53. 5: in haec verba,
L. Caecili, iures postul03 also c. 15· 10: sed quid ego vos, de vestro
impendatis, hortor ?

19 armato togatoque] ‘ in war and peace.y

τι §10- auxilium] refers to the z'us auxilii of the tribunes of the
plebs, whereby they could interfere to rescue a plebeian from arbitrary
oppression on the part of a patrician magistrate.

quatenus imperari vobis sinatis] ‘how far you are to suffer
yourselves to be lorded over.' Lit. ‘it to be lorded over you.’ The
negative character of the tribunate is emphasized‚ see below, ἓ 13.
²4 usu possidemini] ‘you become theirs by mere use! The expression
is a legal one. Full ownership could, by Roman law, be acquired by
simple possession of the object for one or two years, cf. Ulpian 19. 8:
usucapio est autem dominii adeptio per continuationem possessionis anni
vel biennii. Possessio denoted occupation, whether with or without
legal title; hence it is implied here that the patricians have no right to
the superiority which they assume. Cf. 1. 46. 1: iam usu hamt dubie
regnum possederat, i.e. Servius Tullius had not been formally elected
king, but had secured his position by possession.

31 ἓ 13. expertum] Pass. sense, though from deponent verb, cf. ἓ 4.

53 resisterent] The tribunate of the plebs was in origin a purely
negative office. Gradually, however, the tribunes won a considerable
power of initiative in legislation‚ when they ceased to be mere officers of
the plebs, and became real magistrates of the people.

p. 26. ρ ξ 14. prohibete ius de pecuniis dici] Manlius’ aim is a
χρεῶν ἀποκοπή, or universal repudiation of debts. This could be
effected‚ if the tribunes of the plebs intersered to rescue every debtor
who had been adjudged to his creditor. For the phrase, cf. z. 27. 1:
quam asperrime poterat ius de creditis pecuniis dicere.

3 patronum] The relation between the patron and the client was of
the most sacred character3 hence the pride with which Manlius claims
the name. Cf. the XII Tables: Patronus si clienti fraudem fecerit, sacer
esto. Also Verg. Aen. 6. 609, where fraus innexa clienti suffices to
consign,the guilty one to the nethermost· hell. Fides, no doubt, is
intended to stand in contrast to this much—detested fraus.
