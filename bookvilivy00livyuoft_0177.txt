xxxv ξύ] NOJES. 135

22 § 2. accingendum] ‘they must gird themselves! The ⁴Latin passive
not infrequently has a reflexive or middle signification; indeed it is
probable that it was a middle in origin. Cf. the Greek, where certain
forms serve sor both middle and passive. Cf. 26. 7. 6: una ea cura
angebat, ne, uln‘ abscessisset, extemplo dederentur, where dederentur
means ‘should surrender themselves! 50 we sind appelli, ‘to push
oneself in ’; pasci, ‘to seed onesels,⁷ etc.

⁴26 ἓ 3. fieri] sc. cos.

²9 §4- leges] ‘bills’; they had not yet become laws. The purpose
of these proposals was evidently (i) to give the richer plebeians access
to an office which brought with it so much social distinction and in-
fluence, and (2) to relieve the poorer plebeians from the pressure of
debt. and to give them a new start in life by supplying them with land.

,30 unam de aere alieno] This is identical with the proposal os Manlius
(c. 15. ιο). The measure amounted to an abolition of interest on loans
previously contractem it was not so sweeping a remedy as that of
Solon, which was, according to the best authorities (Plut. Sol. 15,
Arist. Ἀθ. Πολ. ιο), a χρεῶν ἀποκοπή, or novae tabulae, to use the
Roman expression.

32 pensionibus] ‘ instalinents.’ It is the usual word in this connection
(cf. 7. 27. 3), but portionibus os the MSS. might be correct⁴ Pensionibus
is hardly a sufficiently out-of-the-way word to need a gloss, as porlimti-
bus is supposed to be.

5 ⁶. de modo agrorum] Suspicion has not altogether unjustifiably
arisen with regard to this law, which, in the extent of land implied,
does not well accord with a time previous to the subjugation of Italy.
It is probably another instance of the tendency to read into early history
situations which occur in later times, but it does not follow that no bill
to limit the amount of land which could be occupied was introduced at
this period. See Introd. p. xxlx.

P, 48, 2. consulumque] An ut must be supplied from the pre—
ceding ne, unless it has fallen out before ulique.

utique] ‘at least'; cf. c. 40. 16, where Appius Claudius inveighs
against this condition. The experience of the plebeians at the elections
of consular tribunes had convinced them of the necessity of the proviso;
at this period there was little danger of both consuls being plebeians; cs.
c. 37. 4: nisi alterum consulem ulique ex plebe fieri neccsse sit, neminem
sore.

6 5 Β. agri, pecuniae, honorum] Cf. Macaulay, sacohite‘s Epitafflz:

For him 1 threw lands, honours, wealth away,
And one dear hope, that was more prized than they.
