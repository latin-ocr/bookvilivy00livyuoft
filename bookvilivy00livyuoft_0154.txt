112 LIVY. Vl. [xxi §3

tion of war, however, lay with the Comitia Centuriam, not with the
Camilia Tm'buta, as he states (lircctly afterwards: cf. c. 22. 4.

²7 ἓ 4. qumquemos...triumviros] The numbers of these extra-
ordinary commissioners varied according to the extent of the land
which had to be surveyed and divided2 thus twenty were appointed
by Caesar’s agrarian law (59 B.C.). These connnissioners were elected
by the Comitia, usually as the result of a proposal by the Senate.

αδ Nepete] Ace. of motion towards. We should say ‘for founding
a colony at Nepete.’ The colony was no doubt the result of the events
recorded in c. 10; the importance of the place as an outpost against
Etruria would render the step advisable, while the colonization might
give some relies to the distressed plebeians.

3¹ ἓ 5. omnes tribus] This cannot be right, sor the declaration of
war was never passed in the Camilia T rihula. As in 5. ιδ. 2, the
confusion between the Camilia 'lb-ilauta and the Comitia Centuriala
seems due to the tribal basis according to which the centun'es were
distributed in the later period of the Republic. The reform, by which
each tribe surnished ten centurie-5, must have taken place between the
First and the Second Punic XVars.

p. 30. 1 §a et] ‘and indeed⁷; cf. c. ιι. 9n.

3 §¹7- mennabat] The full sentence would be: ‘the majority was
leaning towards the sending, (and would have sent), had not, etc.’ Livy
is fond of this idioin, whereby the true apodosis is suppressed and its
place taken by a seeming apodosa's in the indie, cf. 3. 43. 7: et Romam
ferri prasinus Siccium placebat, (and he would have been carried there),
ni decemviri funus militare ci publica impensa facere: maturassent. Cf.
also Verg. Ecl. 7. 45: numeros memini (a fact), si verba tmerem
(Ι should remember the whole song).

5 piacula] ‘scapegoats' to appease the anger of the Romans. The
word means primarily a victiin offered to appease the anger of the gods.

6 ξ 8. senatu] N otice that this refers to the colonial Senate‚ not to
the Roman. The names of many of the political institutions of Rome
are found in the Latin cities also, but we cannot be sure that the functions
os the Latin Senates corresponded to those of the Roman Senate. The
Latin dictators and praetors have only the name in common with the
Roman magistrates bearing these titles; cf. c. 26. 4n.

9 ξ 9. Praenestinorum] Praeneste, Tusculum, Gabii, and Labici
all lay E. or S.E. of Rome. See map. The growing discontent of the
oldestffmembers of the Latin League indicates the fact that Rome
was growing more oppressive in consequence os her successes against
the Etruscans and Volscians. See Introd. §4b.
