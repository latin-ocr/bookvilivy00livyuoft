constructions marks the beginning of the decline from classical Latin.
Cf. c. 30. 9: Selium, {fisis qucrenlsbus.

Sutrium was a place of great iinportance, commanding as it did the
route between N. and S. Etruria. Livy does not say when it entered
into alliance with Rome, but it probably did so shortly aster the sall of
Veii (396 B.C.). Later on, in 383 B.C. (Vell. Pat. 1. 14. 2), Sutrium
became a Latin colony, and, together with Nepete, marked sor some
tinne the boundary os Roman territory to the N.; cs. Introd. 54, and see
niap.

v26 primo quoque tempore] ‘ at the first possible opportunity.’ Distin-
guish between this meaning and that of ‘one aster another,’ which
sometimes attaches to primus quisque, c.g. in 42. 32. 7: cum tribuni
ml'lc'lum, qui centuriones essent, primum quemque citarent. Primo
qnoque tempore is explained by Kiihner (Aussz'c'lzr. Gramm. 2, p. 474)
thusz—Is possible, the thing shall be done on the first day3 sailing that,
on the second, and so on. Hence ‘at each first opportunity’ is
equivalent to ‘as soon as possible.⁷

27 ἕ 3. spei moram] ‘the postponement of the looked sor relies-³

30 singulis] might mean either ‘ with one change of raiment ' or ‘ with
only one garment on them.² Plutarch evidently took it to mean the
latter (Cam. 35): αὐτοὶ δὲ πάντων ἐνδεεῖς ἐν ἱματίοις μόνον ἀφειμένοι
(ἔτυχον), and Livy’s general usage savours this interpretation.

3⁴2 ἓ 4. cui...ad pedes] ‘at whose seet.’ In 34. 1 1. 5 we have thegen.
'flentes ad genua consulis provolvuntur.

p. 5. 3 excepisset] ‘followed' Exn-ismae is used to express succession
of events; cf. 2. 4. 5: sermonem excepit (of the ear following and
catching up a soun(l); also 5. 13. 4: lrislcm hiemem pestilens aestas
excipit (of summer following upon winter).

4 luctum lacrimasque] ‘ woe and weeping.' Livyis fond of alliteration;
cf. c. 14. 8: cum patria, penalibus puhlicis ac prt'valt's, and c. 17. 2:
libertatem ac luc-em.

7 ἓό. ad Sutrium] mciy mean ‘to the neighbourhood of Sutriun1‚‘
but Livy constantly uses prepositions with the names οἱ towns, where
the normal constr. would be the simple acc. or abl.; cf. c. 26. 8: ab
Tmculo legiones 7·eductae; c. 27. 7 ab A nlt'o Sam-icum, ab Satrico
lisimas..quriones ductas. The prepositions are probably inserted with
a view to clearness; cf. Suet. Aug. 86, where Augustus is said to have
made an increased use of prepositions in order to express his meaning
with greater exactncss.

δ’ soluta omnia] ‘all discipline relaxed.’
