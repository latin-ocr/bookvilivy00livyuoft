xxxin §4] NOTES. 13¹

CHAPTER XXXIII.

22 § 1. seditio] ‘dissensione' The word regularly used of the
struggles between patricians and plebeians at Rome is here applied
to the quarrel between allies.

23 in quo...consenuera.nt] This piece of rhetorical exaggeration seems
to apply to the Volseians rather than the Antiates5 cf. c. 2. 13 aud c. 12
passim. For the Antiate war, see c. 6. 4 ff.

²4 spectarent] ‘ were contemplating)

27 ἓ 2. utrisque...a1teros] The plur. is regular, when two sets os
persons are referred to, as, in this ease, the Latini and the Antiatem
cf. 36. 16. 5: Aetolorum utraeque manus Heracleam sese incluserunt.

per...quo minus] Translate: ‘that the others in no way prevented
them from....’ In 2. 31. 11 we find quin aster the phrase, but quominus
is usual 5* ne is also found occasionally.

28 ἓ 8. a] To be tal-:en with sese vindicaverunt: ‘by depa1·ting...sreed
themselves from?

29 Antiates...dedunt] ‘the Antiates, as soon as these inconvenient
witnesses of· their salutary decision were removed, surrendered their city
and lands to the Romans.‘ Weiss. says that urbem refers to Satricum,
not Antium, but this does not seem probable. The sense is simply that
the Antiates were afraid to surrender so long as the Latins were with
them, but, as soon as they were gone, adopted the wise plan os a
voluntary submission. The problem raised by the calm retreat os the
Latins under the eyes of the Romans was not one likely to disturb
Livy.

3² §4- Volscos] It will be observed that here Livy identifies the
Antiates with the Volsci ; cf. ἓ 1.

p. 45. 4 matris Matutae templum] Mater Matuta was a very ancient
Italian goddess, whose worship must have been widely spread. We
find evidence os her cult at Rome, where her temple was restored and
re-dedieated in 396 B.c. (cf. 5. 19. 6 and 5. 23. 7), and where she was
annually worshipped at the festival of the Matralia on June 11th3 she
was also worshipped at Pisaurum in Umbria, and at Praeneste.

With regard to the character of the goddess, it is clear that she was
an ancient deity of matrons, and it is likely that her aid was invoked at
child-birth. She may also have been a goddess of the dawn (ef. mane,
matutinus), and hence it has been plausibly conjectured that she was
specially concerned with births that took place in the morning. Prof.
