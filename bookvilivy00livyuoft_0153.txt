Cassius is said to have suffered a similar sate. lt should be noted
that Cicero (de domo 38. 101) gives a rather disserent version with
regard to the house of Manlius: cius damma avorsum duobus lucis
conveslz'lam vidais. See map.

31 ἓ 14. gentis Manliae decreto] Just as the paterfamilias had
jurisdiction in the fiznulz'a, so the gcnliles had the right of issuing
deerees in matters affecting the welsare of the gens. It is a fact that
after this date we meet with no patrician Manlius bearing the praenomen
Marcus. Cf. Cic. Phil. 1. 13. 32, and especially Suet. Tib. 1, where
the gens Claudia is said to have issued a similar prohibition: cum
praenominibus cqg⁷1201112'¹zc'bzcsqtte variis dist2'113r111.>1et11r‚ Lusii praenomen
consensu repudiavit, postquam e duobus genulibus pradilis eo, aller
latrocinii, caedis aller convictus est.

33 nisi...memorabffis] Livy seems to mean that Manlius might have
attained to the position of a Julius Caesar, had he not been born at
a tinie when the hatred of tyranny was still strong within the Roman
breast. For the brief and pithy form os sentence, cf. Tae. Hisc. 1. 49
(of Galba) : agnulum consensu capax imperii, nisi imperasset.

CHAPTER XXI.

p. 29. 16 ξ 1. excepit] ‘followedy Sec c. 3. 4n.

20 ἓ 2. velut sorte quadam] Again Livy⁷s Stoic satalisni comes out,
though here he half apologizes by velut and quadam.

exercendo Romano minti datos] For this dat. of purpose with the
gerundive‚ cf. decemviri legibus scribendis, and § 4, below, quinque-
viros Pomptino agro dividend0; and, sor the dat. aster a participle, cf.
comitia consulibus rogandis lzaln'ta. It is closely akin to the ‘predicative’
dat.

22 Ianuvinl] Lanuvium was one of the oldest of the Latin cities,
situated on the S.W. spur of the Alban range. It has been suggested
that its present secession was due to the occupation of the ager
Pomptinus.

23 quae...urbs] Here the city is placed in appos. to the enitens, the
converse of Sutrium, socios, c. 3. 2.
