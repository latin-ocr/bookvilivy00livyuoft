ιν § 1] NO'I'ES. 71

ut nt] ‘as is generally the case) This is the usual som] os expres-
sion in Livy; cs. e. 21. 7 and c. 34. 6. The fuller phrase ulferefit is not
so common.

9 ante moenia. patentes portas] See Appendix.

14 §7- 'si qua...possent] ‘in the hope...that they might be able.’
Si qauz-‘if by'any means’; the subi possent is dne to ilie notion of
wish involved. Cf. the Greek ει· with the opt, eg. in ll. 3. 449, 450:
Ἀτρείδης δ’ ἀν’ ὅμιλον ἐφοίτα θηρὶ ἐοικώς, Ι εἴ που ἐσαθμήσειεν Ἀλέξανδρον
θεοειδέα. Notice the past tenses side by side with the historic present
inveniunt.

15 portas] See Appendix.

17 ξ 8. accensum...fuisset] Strictly speaking ficisset (instead of essel)
should indicate a state, ‘would have been kindled and remained so.'
But Livy is by no means cnresul to maintain the distinction between
sueram and eram, and between fuissem and essem. Below (ἓ 10)
traditum ficerat=tradilnm erat (a simple act). In the case of sm'
and fizisse the idea of a state is more osten present3 cf. 1. 19. 3:
bis deindepost Numae regnum (lausus fuit, lit. ‘was in a closed con-
dition.⁸ The rule, however, is not a hard and fast one in Latin, for a
sentence such as Omnis Gallia divisa est has clearly more reference to
the ensuing state than to a specifie act of division. In some cases sui
indicates that a state has existed, but has now ceased to exist, as in
c. 29. 9, tabula...lzis ferme incisa lz'llerls fuit, and in 38. 56. 3, Literni
monumentum monumentoque statua superimposita suit, quam lempeslale
dist‘eclam nuper vidimus ipsi.

18 ab desperatione] Desperatio is practically personified, hence the ab;
‘would have been kindled by the desperate foe'3 cf. c. 6. 11: circum-
sedeai...ab invidia et odio. Others translate ‘in consequence of the
*desperationst as in c. 2. 9: ab contempla.

20 § 9. quibus]=ci quibus.

ἰι tn spe ultima] ‘ so long as hope was very remotes ln expresses the
circumstances in which a person is placed ; cf. in re trepida.

(ῑιιΑῐἾ-ΕΚ IV.

p. 6. 1 ἓ 1. trium simul bellorum] i.e. wars against the Volscians‚
Aequians, and Etmscans. Sinml is practically an attribute ‘simultaneous.’
Livy is very fond os using adverbs in this way, placing them osten
between an adj. and a subst.; cf. c. 39. 6: maximo privatim periculo,
nullo publice emolumento. Perhaps this is an imitation of the Gk
constr.; ct. ὀ πάνυ Περικλῆς, οἱ νῦν ἅνθρωποι, etc.
