122 LIVY. Vl. [XXV11§4

§4- religio erat] ‘ was a matter of religious scrnplc.’ The origin of
this curious superstition is given in 5. 3¹· 6: C. lulius censor decessit ;
in eius locum M. Cornelius suffeclm, quae res postea religioni fuit, quia
eo lustro Roma est captam cf. also 9. 34. 2ο.

23 ξ 5. Vitio creati] Some ceremonial flaw had invalidated their
electiom cf. c. 1. 5 n. A good instance of the nature of such flaws
is found in 4. 7. 3: lertio mense quam inierunt (sc. tribuni militum)
augurum decreta perinde ac vitio creati honore abiere, quod C. Curtius,
qm‘ familiis eorum praefuerat, parum recle tabernaculum cepisset. It was
important to choose the right spot for taking the auspices prior to holding
the electione.

27 ξδ- tabulas publicas] The Tabulae Censoriae, in which were
recorded the amount of property belonging to individuals. It does
not seem probable, however, that debts were registered in them at
this period.

30 obiectari] For the inf. aster cum interim, cf. c. 11. 4n. Cum
interim practically=tamen‚ and does not afsect the constr. ; cf. 4. 51. 4:
iacere tam diu irritas acliones quae de suis commodis ferrentur, cum
interim (le sanguine ac supplicio suo latam legem confestim exerceri.

31 §¹7. ab Antio.. ab Satrico] Cf. e. 3 5n.

p. 38. 3 consistere in contioneJ‘ to take their stand m a mass meeting.’
The expression shows the informa] character of such assemblies.

5 ἓ Β. quod s1]‘ but if.’ Quodis here simply a connecting particle,
probably parallel to the Gk use of ὅ in Thuc. 2. 40. 3: 8 τοῖς ἄλλοις
ἀμαθία μὲν θράσος, λογισμὸς δὲ ὄκνον φέρει. For another view, cf. Munro
on Lucr. 1. 82; he adopts the explanation that quod is an old abl.=qua
re, ‘therefore' Cf. quod ubi in c. 7. 2 and c. 8. 2.

6 addici] The judicial handing over of the debtor to the creditor.
See e. 11. 8 and c. 18.14nn.

9 sui] Partitive gen„ ‘what of his own. This departure from the
normal suum seems due *to Livy's fondness for variety of construction;
so alieni for alienum.

10 supersit] Utrum is omitted, as often. Cf. c. ¹4· 11 n.

nervo] See c. 11. 8n. The state os affairs prevailing at Rome at

this time should be compared with the similar distress at Athens in the
time of Solon; cf. Solon Fr. 2. 33 ff.:

ταῦτα μὲν ἐν δήμῳ στρέφεται κακά· τῶν δὲ πενιχρῶν

9

ἱκνοῦνται πολλοὶ ’γαῖαν ἐς ἀλλοδαπὴν
⁷ πραθέντες δεσμοῖσί τ’ ἀεικελίοισι δεθέντες.
The cause of distress was similar in both cases, viZ. the missortunes
