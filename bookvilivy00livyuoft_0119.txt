v ξ 8] NOTES. 77

Such alterations and interpolationis were by no means uncommon in the
Roman annals.

ἓ ¹7. occepere]=inierunt. An archaism very likely borrowed froin
the annalists used by Livy. The word is fairly common in Plautus and
Terence.

ἓ 8. aedes Martis] This temple cannot be identified with certainty.
But most probably it was the one outside the Porta Capena (S. os Rome,
beginning of the Via Appia) between the 1st and 'znd milestones.
Cf. 7. 2 3. 3: extra portam C asenam ad Martis aedem. See map.

The notices at the end of this chapter illustrate well the short, ‹lry
character of the annals which surnished the basis of Roman History.

duumviro sacris faciendis] One of the keepers of the Sibylline
Books, which were stored in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. The
Sibylline Books were consulted on the occasion of any grave national
crisis, and they were usually found to prescribe the introduction of some
foreign rite. Hence it has been conjectured that the temple of Mars
mentioned here was really a temple to the Greek Ares, whose worship
was introduced at this time os national unrest. The number of the
keepers of the Sibylline Books was raised from two to ten in 367 B.C.,
and the college was thrown open to plebeians (see c. 37. 12 n.). In
51 B.C. we fi‘nd fifteen niembers of the college, probably in consequence
of reforms introduced by Sulla.

The usual practice in dedicating temples was either to appoint a
magistrate as dedicator, or to elect duumviri aedi dedicandae, extra-
ordinary commissioners appointed from time to time as occasion
required3 cf. the 111 viri coloniae deducendae (c. 21. 4). Some have
thought that Livy made a mistake here, and that he really meant to
write duumviro aedi dedicandae. ,

ex novis civibus] Cf. n. on c. 4. 4. Rome was able to extend her
territory in consequence of the conquests in S. Etruria.

Stellatina] Festus, an epitomator of the great Augustan scholar
and antiquary M. Verrius Flaccus, has a mutilated note, probably to
the following effect :—Stellali[na tribus dicta non a campo eo] qui in
Campania est, sed eo qui [propexabest ab urbe Ca] pena, ex quo Tusci
profecti Sl[ellalz‘num illum] campum appellaverunt. The trihus Stella-
tina, therefore, was in the neighbourhood of Capena, and the district is
to be distinguished from the ager Stellatinus in Campania. The
position of the tribus Tromentina is not exactly known, but it probably
lay around Veii. The tribus Sabatina took its name from the lacus
Sabatinus to the N. of Veii. The tribus Arniensis has, of course,
