CHAPTER XX.

With this ehap. cs. Introd. ξμς.

¹4 §1- utique] ‘at least‚’ a liiniiing particle; cf. c. 35. 5: consulum
utique aller, ‘at least one of the consuls.’ There is a ‹lifl'erent use of
the word with negatives, when it serves to make the negative more
emphatic; cf. 2. 59. 4: monades, ne utique experiri vellet imperium,
‘ that he should not on any account...'

15 sordidatum] Cf. c. 16. 4 and 8nn.

ξ 2. non modo...] ‘and saw with him not merely no patrician, but
not even relations, etc! Nec-...palrum quemquam τοί. . ‚palrum neminem,
while the neg. ne in 11e...quidem is superfluous aster nec; cf. c. 25. ron.

16 cognatos] These are blood-relations; affines are marriage connec-
tions. Agnati, on the other hand, are blood-relations traced through
the male line only.

18 venisset] Subj. in or. obliqua, expressing the thought in the minds
of the plebs.

¹9 ἓ 3. App. Claudio] See 3. 58. 1. Appius Claudius was the
decemvir, insamous sor his crime against Verginia; he is said to have
committed suicide in prison.

υ, primus] Cs. c. 11. 7n.

24 5 4. fallax indicium] The charge of embezzling the aurum
Gallicum.

26 ἓ 6. noc dubito] For the constr. with the acc. and infi, cf. η. 2 n.
The remark is an excellent illustration os the way in which Livy shirks
difficulties. He candidly admits there were no proofs of treason, yet
seels sure Manlius must have been guilty; cf. the way in which he
(leals with the difficulty connected with the numbers of the Volscians
in c. 12. “

‘27 plebi] This must be an inaccuracy. In ἓ 10 Livy says that the
trial took place before the Comitia Centuriata in the Campus Martius,
and in any case a purely plebeian assembly could not possibly have
decided a charge of high treason. This is another instance of Livy's
indifference to constitutional details ‚ his main interest is in the moral to
be drawn from the story (illud notandum, etc.).

3¹ ὅσ. expensas pecunias tulisset] simply means ‘had lent money.‘
Lit. ‘sor whom he had entered sums (into the account book) as pald out.’
On the other hand, acceplum refero means ⁴1 owe,’ cf. Cic. Verr. 11. 1.
39. 100: quod minus Dolabella Verri acceptum rettulit, quam Verres
