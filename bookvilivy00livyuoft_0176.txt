134 lJVY. Vl. [xxxiv §5

41. 18. (15): quando dm) ordinarii consules eius anni, aller morbo, aller
[ων-ο periisset.

23 affinitas] ‘marriage connection '3 cf. c. 20. ι· n.

ς’ 6. cum...tererent] Cf. Cic. pro Mil. 1ο. 28: paulisper, dum se
uxor, utfil, comparat, commoratus cst. The ‘ ulfit' is gently ironical.
²9 risui sorori fuit] Risui is a predicative dat.: ‘she brought a smile

upon her sister's face.’

This story is evidently a pure invention, for, as has been osten
pointed out, the younger Fabia could not have been ignorant of the
custom, seeing that her father had been consular tribune (c, 22. 5).
Weiss. cites, in illustration of the prhctice, Plin. N. H. 7. 112: Cn.
Peslzpcius...2'nt1¹aturus Posidonii domum...fi7res percuti de more veluit.

32 g ¹7. num quid vellet] Here in the straightsorward sense: ‘if he
had any commands to give.’ But like our ‘good *bye,' originally: ‘God
be with you,’ numquid vis came to be used without any thought of the
real meaning, simply as a formula of leave-taking.

p. 47. 1. malo arbitrio] Au instance of Livy's tendency to moralise.

2 ἓ 8. confusam] Cf. c. 6. 7, where, however, the cause of confusion

is different.

3 morsu animi] ‘ annoyance.'

satin' salve] ‘is anything amiss?’; cf. 1. 58. 7, where Lucretia's
husband greets her with these words. The expression is colloquial, and,
with the spelling salve, may be explained as=sal1'n’ salve agis ?,·salzee
being an adv. This seems the correct spelling, not salvae, though with
the latter the phrase can be easily explained as=sale'n’ salvae res se
habent?

4 piam] ‘kind.' Pietas often means the ‘ right feeling‘ which should

subsist between members of a family.

6 ἓ 9. elicuit...ut] ‘ induced her t0.’

7 impari] Through lack of the genus patricium.

8 honos] = ‘the consulship.' See c. 37. 5 n.

2 ξ 11. cuius spei...deesset] The phrase is equivalent to· an adj.

balaneing strenam cf. c. 35. 5: cuncta ingentiayet quae sine certamine
maximo obtineri non possent. ¹

CHAPTER XXXV.

21 ἓ 1. ms1...1ooat1s] ‘ unless their representatives were placed! This
constr. of nisi with an abl. abs. is a favourite one with Livy; cf. e. 37. 4:
utsz' imperio cmnnunimto.
