Rome seemcd to be emerging successfully from her life-and-
death struggle with the surrounding peoples, the Etruscans ou
the North, the Aequi on the Eam, and the Volscians on the
South. The burning of the city was a grievous, but by no
means a crushing blow, and one of the great features of
interest in this book is the triumphant way in which Rome
rises again from what seemed at first to be her ruin. At last
she succeeds in securing herself thoroughly against her two
most formidable neighbours, the Etruscans and the Volscians.
Now too comes the first decided break with the Latins and the
Hernicans, who make common cause with the Volscians, and
thus are foreshadowed the supremacy of Rome over her former
allies and the dissolution of the Latin League (338 B.C.). A
turning point in the history of the city has been reached3
henceforward the Romans will carry their arms against new
foes, beginning with the Italians, until finally they become
masters of the world. Herein then lies the key to the interest
of the wars recorded in this book, Regard them as an inter-
minable series of struggles‚ leading to no tangible result, and
they seem dull and monotonous; but once take a broader view,
and see in them the first step towards Rome's great conquests,
and they will appear in a very different light. We can now
see clearly that these wars, the fruits of which were secured
from time to time by the foundation of colonies, were the
prelude to that peace near at home, without which she could
never have gained supremacy over the rest of Italy, and atter-
wards over the world.

ln a similar way substantial progress marks the internal
history also. There are two great causes of discontent among
the plebeians, viz. economic distress and political inequality.
While the former is brought into most vivid relies by the story
of Manlius, the latter is strongly emphasized by the struggles
ι leading to the laws of Licinius and Sextius. It is true that the
measures introduced for the relies of the small landowner are
unsatisfactory, and calculated to give a temporary respite only,
not to effect a cure. All through the history of the Republic
the same economic difficulties are constantly arising, and in
the end contribute largely to its downfall. On the other hand
