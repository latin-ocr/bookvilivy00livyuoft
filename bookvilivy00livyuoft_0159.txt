m go or( er.

²4 ferociae] ‘boldness‚’ not ‘ferocity.'

event. ‘WVhen ' is used in a precisely similar way in English.

subiectus] ‘ listed’ on horscback, probably because of his advanced
age, which had impaircd his activity. As parallels are quoted 3¹- 37. 10:
saluti fuit cqnes, qui raptim &siluit pavidumque regem in equum subierit,
and Aen. η. 288: corpora saltu Ι subiciunt in equos.

26 oppositis] Le. to bar the flight of the Romans, not to (beck the

ι 5 ἓιο. 0ptimum visum est...equos] The MSS. give flucsuantem
aciem, but the change to fluctuante acie is very slight, final m being

retained, we must translate: ‘it scemed best, considering the wavering
of the line, that the hon-scs should be handed over (to the grooms).’
But it is almost impossible to extract all this from tradi. Something
like optimum visum est ex stucltmnle acie extrahi equos might be
suggested: ‘that the horses should be withdrawn from the wavering
line.’ See Appendix.

16 invadere] The sudden change from passive to act. inf. is quite in
Livy's manner3 cf. 5. 39. 11: placm‘t...ls⁷e³t‹1les sacra publica...auserre,
