speedily brought on a sharp conflict. Money had to be borrowed
to meet the expenses of rebuilding and restocking, and the
succession of wars with the surrounding peoples not only brought
an additional burden in the form of an increased war tax, but
also prevented the proper working of the farms; cf. c. 11. 9 . et
erat aeris alieni magna vis re damnosissima etiam divitibus,
aedificando, contracla. The miseries of this time are vividly
illustrated by Livy, as his wont is, by the picture of the centurion
handed over by judicia] sentence to the mercy of his creditor,
aster all attempts to stem the overwhelming tide of usury had
been made in vain ; they are further impressed upon us by the
whole story of Manlius, which entirely hinges upon the harsh
operation of the law of debt. The delay in the appointment of
consors (cc. 27, 31) increased the confusion which prevailed
with regard to property, and led to the utter demoralisation
described in c. 34. If we cannot consider the details given by
Livy as trustworthy‚ there is no doubt that he has succeeded in
what was evidently his main purpose—in impressing upon his
readers the reality of the economic distress prevalent in Rome
aster the burning of the city.

(4) The Story Of M. Manlius. “Apa δὲ τούτοις πραττομένοις
κατὰ τὴν Ἰταλίαν ἐν τῇ Ῥώμῃ ΜάρκοςΜάνλιος ἐπιβαλόμενος τυραννίδι
καὶ κρατηθεὶς ἀνῃρέθη. Such is the brief sentence with which
Diodorus (15. 35. 3) disrnisses the episode of M. Manlius, out
of which Livy has made so brilliant a story. As we read the
latter’s account, teeming as it does with incident, we cannot
help wondering how much or how little can be regarded as
based on solid fact. Prof. Mommsen (Rom. Forsclz. 2, pp. 179 fs.)
has examined the whole story of Manlius at length, and what
is in the main an outline of the conclusions he has arrived at
may here be given.

First and foremost a large part of the accoun't has arisen
from a desire to connect the seditious M. Manlius of this story
with the legendary saviour of the Capitol. Hence the details
of the trial, at which the memories aroused by the sight of
the Capitol play so important a part, may be put aside as
fabulous. The cognomen Capitolinus was evidently due to
the fact that Manlius lived upon the Capitol, and had nothing
