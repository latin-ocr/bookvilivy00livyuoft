whatever to do with the snving of the citadel, for we find that
the name Capitolinus was borne by the Sestii and Quinctii,
other samilies who also had their dwelling upon the Capitol.
But the false interpretation of the cognomen gave a splendid
opportunity for dilating upon the military exploits of the hero,
and this is done in the minutest detail in Livy's account
(c. 20. 7 ff.). Again, Manlius is represented as the bitter
opponent of the successful aristocratic general M. Furius
Camillus. It is obvious that the story gains much in pictu-
resqueness by the conti-ast between the fortunes of the two
preservers of Rome from the Gauls, one of whom is loaded
with honours by the government‚ while the other is driven
by neglect into the arms of the plebeians. It is probably (lue
to this striving aster effect that Manlius' story is made to
extend over two years (385 and 384 B.C.)‚ in order that his
end may be placed in a year when Camillus is consular tribune.
Prof. Pais (op. cit. vol. Ι, pt. 2, pp. 98 ff.) thinks that the later
quarrels between the gaules of the Furii and Manlii are
anticipated in the present rivalry between Camillus and Manlius.
There are great discrepancies between the various accounts of
the trial and death of Manlius. Livy himself admits that two
versions were current (c. 20. 12). That which represents the trial
as having taken place before duumviri perduellionis would seem
to be the more ancient ; but can we be sure that there was any
trial at all? Dio Cassius (in Zonaras 7. 24) gives a euriously
mixed account. He says that Manlius attempted to seize the
Capitol, but was captured by treachery. Thus far he is more
or less in agreement with Diodorus ; but he subsequently adds
the formal trial and execution after the manner of Livy. This
confusion on the part of the authorities rather inclines one to
the belief that the simple sentence of Diodorus is most likely
to contain the truth‚ and that out of the rising of a Manlius
in the interest of the debtors and out of his violent death the
Livian story has arisen through family traditions and the in·
genuity of annalists.

What value then has the story of Manlius for us? It
impresses upon our minds a fact of the greatest importance
for the proper understanding of the inner history of Rome, viz.
