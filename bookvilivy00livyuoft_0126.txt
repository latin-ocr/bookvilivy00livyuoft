84 JJVV. VJ. [xx §4

31 inis] The Etruscans.
molirentur] Subj. of frequent action: see c. 8. 6n. For the

meaning of moliri, ‘plotted‚’ ef. c. 2. 14 n. (3).

32 §⁵. igitur] More usually second or third in a sentence. But, as
with imque and namque, Livy is inclined to diverge frorn the Classical
prose 01·de1·; ef. c. 4. 8n. In early Latin, Plautus for instance, igilur
osten begins a sentence. Sallust also, who in many peculiarities of
constr. closely resemblcs Livy, always places igitur first.

p. 13.1 cum Camillo agi] Agere cum populo is used technically of
a magistrate laying proposals before an assembly of the people. Hence
we may translate ⁴ that a proposal should be made to Camillus.’

2 legiones urbanae] There can be little doubt that Livy has made a
slip here. Quinctius had (c. 6. ¹4) been placed in command of the
infirm soldiers (causariz) and the seniores ; it was not likely that
Camillus would be represented as taking these troops on what promised
to be a diffieult campaign. We must therefore suppose that the troops
of Q. Servilius are really meant.

ξ 6. quanquam...ma11et] Mallet can be explained as being the
apodosis to si liceret or its equivalent understood. Nevertheless Livy
does use the subj. aster quanquam in passages where such an explanation
is impossible (eg. in 45. 17. 7). In this, as in other usages, he is
leading the way to Silver Latinity.

o in v01scos] See Appendix.

15 §9. tanta] See Appendix.

ιι) ἓ 10. anceps] ‘from both sides) The word means literally
‘double-headed,’ hence its derived meaning ⁴ doubtful) The Etruscans
were exposed to attack both from within and from without the town.

ἓ 11. fug-lentium] ‘the fugitivesss See c. 2. 13 n.

in urbe et. per agros] Here there is some point in the change of
preposition; per gives the idea of the scattering over the face of the
open country. But Livy is constantly varying his prcpositions for purely
stylistic reasons.

CHAPTER X.

p. 14. 6 ἓ 1. tota hostium erat] ‘was wholly in the enemy’s hands:
The gen. is possessive. Cf. lucri tolus esse, ‘to be entirely devoted to
gain,' and c. 14. 9: cum iam unius hominis esset.

9 ἓ 2. implorassent] Subi. due to indit-eet specch; the ambas-
sadors ‘sent to the people of Nepete would say ‘fldem praes-late qua'm
implorastis!
