6. 842. These instances will suffice to show that Livy would
probably have agreed with Quintilian in thinking that history
was ‘very closely allied to poetry‚ and was a kind of poem
untrammelled by metre.’

These remarks on Livy's style may be closed with the
mention of a well-known criticism of C. Asinius Pollio, an
older contemporary of Livy. It is quoted by Quintilian (1. 5. 56:
cf. also 8. 1. 3): Pollio reprehendit in Livio Palavinz’latem. There
has been much discussion as to what this Patavz‘m'tas really was,
but from what has been said above it may be gathered that Livy
departed in many ways from the strict standard of Latin prose
to which Pollio was accustomed. His introduction of new
words and his occasionally poetical diction probably offended
so fastidious a critic, and it is possible that some of the pecu-
liarities of Livy's style had their origin in his provincial up-

bringing‚ though we, of course, cannot dctcct this in the way -

that Pollio could.

§4 THE HISTORY OF THE PERIOD.

(a) lts general characteristica The period of history em-
braced in book V1 lies, according to Livy's chronology, between
the years 389 and 367 ΗΟ. It falls naturally into two main
sections, viZ. the foreign relations and the inner history of the
city. These two divisions will be treated separately and in
greater detail later 0113 an attempt will be made here to indicate
the importance of this period, viewed in its relation to the general
course os Roman history.
