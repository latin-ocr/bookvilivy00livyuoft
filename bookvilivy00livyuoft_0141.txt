xvx §3] NOTES. „ 99

²3 id cogendi estis] Id expresses the extent of the verb’s action, and
is a kind of cognate acc. So, in the act„ cogo is found wilh a double
acc., the one dcnoting the direct object, the other, usually a ncut. pron„
the extentos the verb's action. Cf. Verg. Aen. 3. 56: quid uon mor-
talia pcctora mgis Ι auri sacra sizmes ,2

CHAPTER XVI.
3¹ ἓ 1. peragere verum] Verum is prolcptic 3 ‘to make his· indictment
good.' Cf. c. 12. 9n.

3² insimulati...senatus] ‘of salse accusation against the Senate.'

p. 22. 1 oblataeque vani furti invidiae] ‘and of bringing upon them
the odium of a baseless charge os thest.’ As Weiss. points out, vani is
not strictly applicable to furti, but balances the sentence better by being
placed in agreement with it. This constr. (called by graminarians
‘hypallage’ or ‘interchange') is fairly common in Livy. A good
instance occurs in 8. 7. 18: specimen istud virtutis deceptum vana
imagine decorz'53 we should expect decapite.

3 §2- viatore] Cf. c. 15. 2 n.

Iuppiter...1uno...Minerva] These three deities had separate cellae
in the temple of Jupiter on the Capitolium. Since the time of the
Tarquins they were united as the special protective (leities os Rome, an
innovation probably due to the Etruscans. Cf. c. 4. 3 n.

4 ceterique di deaeque] Weiss. quotes Servius on Vei-g. Gem'g. 1. τι
(dique deaeque omnes, sludium quibus arva tucri): l'cr pontifices m
omnibus sacris post speciales deos, quos ad ipsum sacrum, quoilficbal‚
necesse erat invocari, generaliter omnia numina invocantur. It is very
characteristic of the Roman mind that care is taken to prevent any god
being offended by chance omission. The same feeling comes out in
the common si deus, si ‹l‘ca (cf. 7. 26. 4); cf. also lior. bat. 2. 6. 20:
Matutine pater, seu Iane libentius audis.

5 Sicine] When -ne is· attached to sic, the longer and original form oi
the latter (sice) is used; the same is the case with lzz'c, cf. c. 17. 3:
lzocz’ne. The change from e to z· is due to shifting of accent ς cf. laga and
cdlligo. See Giles, Mamml qulzilology §g 161, 32 5 v.

7 vinoun et catenis] Rhetorica} redundance ; no distinction in
meaning is intended.

8 ἓ 3. nullius nec. . .nec] The negatives do not destroy, but strengthen
one another. Distinguish between nullus nec...nec, nullus nonz‘every
one,' and mm nullus=‘some one.' Cf. c. 23· 9.

sed invicta sibi...fecerat] ⁴ but the state, most submissive to lawsnl
