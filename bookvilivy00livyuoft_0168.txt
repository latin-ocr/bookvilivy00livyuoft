126 LlVY. Vl. [xxlx§9

These inscriptions were written in Saturnian verse, as we learn from
Atilius 1¹‘ortunatianus (ι, ὅ. 2 Gaissonl), a late writer on inette: apud
nostros aulem iu tabulis antiquis, quas triumphaturi duces z'n Capitolio
(ge-bant, victoriaeque suae tilulum „S‘atznm‘is versibus prosequebantur,
talia appari exemplem cf. also 40. 52. 5 ff. and 41. 28. 8ff.

31 §10. die vicesimo] The abdication of the dictator aster such a
short period of office is au illustration of the fact that he was appointed
sor a particular work and was expected, in normal circumstances, to lay
down office inunediately aster that work was completed3 cf. c. 1. 4n.;

temporary revival of plebeian inssuence, since sor several years

proper, which formed the tenth part of a legion and contained three
manipuli, was not created till about the time of the Second Punic
War.

¹4 velut circumventis] ‘under the impression that they had been
surrouuded ’; dat. after pracsidio essent. It will be best to split up the
sentence in translatingss ‘under the impression that these had been
surrounded (for a salse report to that effect had been brought), they
hurried to their protection. They did not, however, even secure the
author of the report—it >was a Latin soe who had deceived them, under
pretence of being a Roman soldier‚-but themselves plunged headlong
into an ambuscade.' '

implies voluntary, praecipitare alone rather involuntary or unconscious
actlon.
