INTRODUCTION.

§L LIFE AND WORK OF LlVY.

ERY little definite information as to Livy's life has come
down to υς, and what we do know must be pieced together
from various sources. Titus Livius (for he apparently had no
cognomen) was born in 59 or 57 stc. at Patavium, the modern
Padua. The place was one of considerable importance at that
time, and carried on an extensive trade with Rome. We are
informed that Patavium was noted for the strict morality of its
inhabitants, for the Younger Pliny (Ep. 1. 14), in writing of a
lady named Serrana, says: nosti loci mores; Serrana lamen
Patavinis quoqne severitatis exemplum est. There can be little
doubt that the immorality which prevailed at Rome appeared
to Livy even darker than it was, when contrasted with the
simplicity of manners which characterised his native town;
and this may to some extent account for the high moral tone
which pervades the history throughout. Livy seems to have
kept almost entirely aloof from the stormy politics of the time
η in which he lived3 he preferred, as he says in his Presace, to
turn away his eyes from the miseries of the dying Republic and
to fix them upon all that was good and great in the past history
of the nation. His sympathies, however, were plainly with the
aristocratic party and the senate. This we might have inferred
from the whole of the extant portions of his work, in which he
regards with disapproval all that savours of a revolutionary
spirit; but we have also the express evidence of Tacitus to
show that he openly praised the Pompeians (A nn. 4. 34): Titus
Livius, eloquentiae ac fidei praeclarus in primis, Cn. Pompeium
