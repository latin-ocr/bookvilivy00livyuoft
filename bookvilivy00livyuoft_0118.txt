publicus was only the work of the nobles, i.e. of the patriciam. It was
rather the rich. whether patrician or plebeian, who contrived to exclude
the poorer citizens.

24 fuerit] For Livy’s habit of retaining the primary tenses in or.
obliqua introduced by a verb in a secondary tense, see c. 39. 11 n.

25 habuerint] See Appendix.

ξ 4. :tn possessionem...grassari] ‘took violent possession of':
>oros-sari is more commonly used with a person as object, cf. 2. 12. 15:
nl in le lta( via grmsaremum Suet. Ner. 36 in externos grassari. The
subst. ιςναςςαιϊπν means a ⁴ sootpad,’ as in Juv. 3. 305: grassator agy't rem.

28 §5. moverunt] See Appendix.

29 eodem] If this reading of the MSS. is retained, eodem must be
referred to aedgfimndi, and the phrasezexlzaustam expensis in eandem
rem. But this explanation seems extremely unlikely. See Appendix.

30 instruendum] ⁴ stocking.’ lnslrnere here means to supply with
iustrumenta.

vires]:c0piae‚ ‘resources⁷ ; cf. 38. 21. 6: obsides inde imperatos pro
viribus inopis populi vicenos. . dederunt.

p. 8. 1 ξδ- religionum] ‘religious fears' or ‘scruples'; cf. 7. 28. 7:
librisque (i.e. the Sibylline Books) impedis, cum plena rengione civitas
esset, placuit dictatorem seriarum constituendarum causa dici.

ut renovarentur auspicia] Presumably the measures taken pre-
viously (c. 1) to appease the gods had not produced the desired result.
As was pointed out in c. 2. 5 n.‚ the auspicia were the means by which
the will of heaven was consulted. These auspicia were taken by the
chief magistrates of the community; if therefore it was considered that
the conduct or mode of eleetion of these magistrates had been in any
way calculated to displease the gods, they were called upon to resign‚ as
not being fit persons to hold intercourse with heaven. An interregmum
followed (see c. 1. 5 n.), and the consultation os the gods was carried out
afresh by the new magistrates5 ef. 5. 17. 3: unam expiationem esse, ut
tribuni militum abdicarent se mageslratu, auspicia de inlegro repeterentur,
et interregnum iniretur.

3 Μ. Manlius capitolinus] The saviour of the Capitol. There can
be no doubt that his cognomen was derived, not from the fact that he
saved the Capitol, but that he dwelt upon the Capitoline hill;
cf. Introd. ἓ 4c. Livy (5. 31. 2) gives M. Manlius, cui Capitolino postea
snit cognomen, as consul sor 392 B.C., but Pros. Mommsen (Rem.
Emeda& p. 179) has shown that the statement is a doubtful one, and
that this Manlius was very likely the A. Manlius given by Diod. 14. ¹03·
