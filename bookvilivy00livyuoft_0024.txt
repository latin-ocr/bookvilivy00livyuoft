his son as quoted by Quintilian (10. 1. 39):fus‘t tgritur brevitas
illa tutsssima qnae est apud Livium in epistola ad filium
scripta, ‘legendos Demosthenem atque Ciceronem, tum ita, ut
quisque esset Demostheni et Ciceroni simillimus! Some indeed
have thought that Livy was a professional teacher of rhetoric,
and it has been mentioned above (ξ 2) that his eloquentia was
particularly noticed by Roman writers.

Book VI affords abundant instances of this special feature of
Livy's style. Wherever an opportunity offers, he loves to insert
a stirring speech. These speeches are sometimes of considerable
length, such as those of Manlius (c. 18. 5ff.) and App. Claudius
(cc. 40. 41), but more often they are short, and spoken under the
influence of strong emotion (cf. c. 6. 12, c. 7. 3, c. 12. 8 etc.).
Very noticeable is the way in which Livy changes suddenly from
the indirect to the direct (cf. c. 6. 12, c. 15. 9 etc.); he appears
to feel himself under restraint so long as he uses the indirect,
but finds relief by breaking out into the more rhetorical direct.
Occasional exaggeration in the course of the narrative, such as
c. 2. 13: septuagesimo anno, c. 33. 1: consenuerant, may be
attributed to the oratorical instinct. Nevertheless, the history
owes much of its charin to this characteristic, which enables
Livy to avoid dulness and monotony‚ even when recounting an
interminable succession of seemingly purposeless wars.

Poetical colonrz'ng. The introduction into prose of words
and phrases of a poetical nature is characteristic of what is
known as silver Latinity. Here Livy begins a practice afterwards
carried to a greater pitch by Tacitus. It seems almost certain
that Livy was acquainted with Virgil and that he had access to
the Aeneid before its formal publication, so many are the
examples of a striking similarity of phrase between the historian
and the poet. The poetical colouring in Livy becomes most
¹pronounced when he is thoroughly animated, as, sor example,
when he is describing some battle scene. A good instance
occurs in c. 12. 8-10, where, in the course os a few lines, we
find obnzlros...stabilz' gradu, micent gladii, haerere iam aciem
collalo pede, and terrorem equestrem3 but the whole passage
has a poetical ring about it.
