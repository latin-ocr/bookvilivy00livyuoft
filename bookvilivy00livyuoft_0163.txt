xxvr1§3] NOTES. 121

semi—colon after attinet. The sense is then plain: ‘the‘re is no need to
disprove what is evidently false; yet, even supposing the charge were
true, it would be safe to admit it.'

p. 37· 1 peccetur...sattsnat] ‘let men offend against you, so long as
you are worthy to receive a satisfaction of this kind) A rather obscure
way of expressing ‘offences against you give you an opportunity of
showing your clemency.'

v2 § 8. fere] It was, of course, well understood that these speeches were
the invention of the historiam and merely served to sum up the situation.

,ς civitatem] It is probable that Livy is wrong in saying that the
Tusculans received the full citizenship shortly after this date, in spite
of passages such as 8. 14. 4 and c. 33. 6. In 8. 7. 2 they are found
joining with the Latins against Rome, while Festus includes them
among the towns which were first granted only half-citizen 1·ights;
it seems likely, therefore, that it is the ct'w'tas sine suffragat) which is
referred to in the present passage. Tusculum, however, is called by
Cicero (pro Plane. 8. 19) municipium antiquissimum, and must in
any case have been one of the earliest Latin towns to receive the
full citizenship: some indeed hold that it already possessed the half· ⁴
citizenshipk and now received full citizen rights. Cf. Greenidge,
Roman Public Life, p. 298 n.

CHAPTER XXVII.

16 ἓ 8. incertam famam aeris alieni] ‘ the uncertain reports which
prevailed with regard to debr) Since four new tribes were created in
387 B.c. from citizens newly enrolled the year before (c. 4. 4 and c. 5. 8),
there must have been censors in 388 13.c.‚ though Livy does not give
their names. It was very important that the amount of land owned by

. a debtor should be ascenained, and that the property should be duly
valued, since otherwise the creditors might easily take an unfair
advantage of their position, and force the ‹lebtors to sell their land
at a low price. Livy also implies that the consors recorded the amount
of debts, but such a record is unlikely.

17 invidiosius] See Appendix.

18 elevaretur] ‘was being minimised '3 cf. c. 23. 4.

qulbus fide...expediebat] ‘to whose advantage it was that credit
should appear to be endangered by lael< of saith rather than lael< of
fortune on the part of the debtors.' The context makes it clear how
fides and sor-luna are to be understood. 'l'hc creditors wished it to he
believed that the debtors could pay, but would not.
