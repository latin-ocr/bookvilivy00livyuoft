INTRODUCTJON. ξ 2. xiii

Claudius Quadrigariuj began his history with the Gallie war of
Wffit is very probable that Livy made pretty
extensive use of his work for the period covered by the present
book; but if he used Claudius as the main authority son the
wars of these years, it is certain that he consulted other annalists
from time to time, with the result that the same event is some-
times given' twice over. In relating the events connected with
the Licinio-Sextian rogations he would be sure to draw largely
on Licinius Macer. Other authorities he may have used are
Valmd Q. Aelius Tubero. Now all these annalists
wrote some 300 years or more after the events which this book
professes to describe, so that at best they were very unsatis-
factory guides to follow. But besides this, there is good reason
to believe that Valerius Antias (cf. 36. 38. 7) and Licinius Macer
(cf. 7. 9. 5) were sometimes guilty of deliberate falsification. Of
the earlier authorities, Ω. Fabius Pictor (about the time of the
2nd Punic War), who wrote in Greek, and L. Calpurnius Piso
(cons. 133 ΒΩ), Livy probably made but little use, and perhaps
his references to them are taken from the later annalists. He
did not therefore always use the best authorities available3 let
us now look at his methods of criticising those he did use.
There are one or two instances in the present book. In
c. 12. 2 Livy is struck by the constant recurrence of the Volscian
wars, and indeed he may well be so. He then hazards a series
of conjectures in explanation, none of which can be considered
very plausible. It never seems to occur to him that the same
campaign may have got repeated again and again in slightly
varied form, or that trivial border forays may have been magni-
fied into great wars. In c. 20. 4 he remarks that he can find
among the authorities no very definite acts of treason laid to
the charge of Manlius. This surely might have aroused his
suspicions as to the correctness of some of the details of the
story. However, he lightly passes by the difficulty with the
remark that there were doubtless good grounds for the con-
demnation. Similarly in c. 20. 12 he mentions that the authorities
differ as to the form of trial which Manlius underwent, but he
makes no effort to get at the exact truth. One more instance of
Livy's want of critical faculty may be mentioned3 in c. 42. 5
