the legislation of Licinius and Sextius. Their measures will be
discussed further on ; meanwhile another great cause of plebeian
agitation must be touched on.

(3) The question of debis. This was, as we have seen,
very closely bound up with the agrarian question. The man
who owned but little land and had but a small amount of capital
was exposed to constant risk. A single bad harvest or the raid
of an enemy might leave him helpless ; he might at any time be
summoned to join the army, and in his absence his property
would suffer for want of attention. The only resource of the
ruined farmer was to borrow money from the richer citizens,
whether patrician or plebeian. But the law of debt in ancient
society was of extreme severity. Thus Athens at the time of
Solon had passed through a crisis owing to the cruel use made
by creditors of their advantage over debtors; cf. Plut. Solon 13:
χρέα λαμβάνοντες ἐπὶ τοῖς σώμασιν, ἀγώγιμοι τοῖς δανείζουσιν ἦσαν,
οἶ μὲν αὐτοῦ δουλεύοντες, οἱ δέ ἐπὶ τῇ ξένῃ πιπρασκόμενοι. So too
at Rome the person of the debtor was at this time regarded as
the ultimate “security for the debt, with the result that, if the
loan were not repaid by a fixed date and if the debtor's property
did not cover its value, the creditor could seize him and make
him work off the debt by personal labour. At Athens the power
of the creditor over the debtor's person was abolished by the
Solonian legislation ; at Rome it was considerably restricted by
the Poetilian law of 326 ΗΟ, but was not finally abolished till
'the time of Julius Caesar. Another hardship was the exorbitant
rate of interest charged. In this connection may be quoted a
passage from Tac. A nn. 6. 16: sane vetus urbi senebre malum
et seditionum discordizcrumqnc creberrima causa, eoque colli-
bebatur anliqtcis quoque el ricinus corruptis moribus. nam

Twelve Tables (probably 10 per cent. on the year of 12 months)
had no doubt been disregarded in the confusion following the
Gallie invasion, and thus the relations between debtor and
creditor, at all times liable to give rise to a critical situation,
