JNTROD UCTJON. ἕ 4. xxi

the battle for politica} equality is fought once sor all and won
by the plebeians. With the close of this book an old order of
things has passed away. The noble clans have been compelled
to surrender their exclusive claim to the chief magistracy, with
the result that the Roman state is hencesorward really one, no
longer twofold. The new nobility which arises is drawn equally
from patrician and plebeian ranks, and consists of men who
have by personal merit won for themselves the highest office in
the state.

(b) External relalions. It is not necessary to show at any
great length that the details of the wars recorded in this book
are quite untrustworthyl. One or two pieces of evidence will
suffice. In c. 3 we find an account of a brilliant victory gained
by Camillus over the Etruscans in 389 B.C.; three years later
(c. ιο) a no less brilliant victory is won by the same Camillus at
the same place. Now it was seen above (p. x) that the silence
of the ‘elogium' of Camillus as to this second campaign confirms
our otherwise very reasonable suspicions as to its ever having
taken place at all. The series of victories over the Volscians
is not less open to doubt. We are told in c. 2. 13 that Camillus
brought the Volscians to surrender after a seventy years' war;
yet three years after (e. 8) they are again in arms and afford
Camillus another triumph. Once more in c. 24 M. Furius
Camillus, in spite of the rashness of his colleague L. Furius,
completely routs the Volscians for the third time. These

0 victories cannot be regarded as historieally trustworthy. It

may be that some member of the gens Furia deliberately
inserted victories into the annals for the further glorification
of the heroic M. Furius; it may be, as Prof. Pais suggests,
that there has been much confusion between the exploits of
M. Furius and those of his son L. Furius; οι· again, Livy may
have repeated the same events inadvertently in the course of
consulting several annalists. Yet though the details are un-

¹ A minute analysis of the history comprised in book vx will be
found in Prof. Ettore Pais' Storia d' Italia dai tempi pit> antichi sino
alle guerre punit-lie, vol. 1. pt ¹2, ch. 6; the conclusions arrived at,

however, are of a very sceptical character and should be received with
much cantion.
