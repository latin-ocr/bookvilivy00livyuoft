12 ἓ 9. pace deorum] ‘ the savour of heaven ⁹ ; cf. c. 1. 12.

13 pontifices, augures, sacrificuli reges] Religious offiees at this time
strictly confined to patricians. The rex sacrificulus is better known as
rex sacrorum. He was theoretically the inheritor of the old religious
functions of the Kings, but was, in reality, of little importance, being
quite subordinate to the Pontifex Mra-imus. Ι Ie announced the coming
festivals of the month upon the Nones; he was also regarded as the
representative head of Roman family life (cf. the βασιλεύς at Athens).
The small amount of influence attaching to this office is indicated by
the fact that, even to the latest times, the rex sacrorum was selected
from the patricians only, whose monopoly in this point the plebs did
not think it worth while to contest. On the other hand, the colleges
of pontifices and augurs, who had real political importance, were thrown‘
open to the plebs by the lex Ogulnia of 300 B.C.

¹4 apicem Dialem] i.e. the special hat worn by the Flamen Dialis
or pricst of Jupiter; it was also known as albogalerus from its whiteness.
Apex is here put instead offlamen, the wearing of the albogalcrus being

The apex, which was worn by the Salii and all the flamines, was
essentially a pointed piece of olive wood, surrounded with wool; the
cap, to which this was attached, was usually, though not invariably,
conical in shape. Here apex is used for the cap and piece of wood
combined. The Flamen Dialis, together with the Flamen lllartz'alzlr
and Flamen Quirinalis, was known as' a Flamen maior, and was chosen
to the end from the ranks of the patricians.

15 ancilia] The shields in the custody os the Salii or priests of Mars,
and carried anuually in processior] by thern during the month of March.
According to legend the original shield fell from heaven, and the re-
maining eleven were copies of it. The ancile closely resembled in shape
the figure 8 ; the word is perhaps derived from an (=a7tzb, as in anceps)
and caedo, i.e. cut in on both sides.

The Salii were divided into two colleges, each consisting os
12 mcmbers. The Salii Palatini owed their institution, as it was said,
to Numa, while the younger Salii Collini were created by Tullus Hostilius.
The Salii were to the last chosen srom patricians only.
