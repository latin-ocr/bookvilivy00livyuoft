72 ΗΜΛ Vl. [ιν § 2

3 ς· 2. sub hasta. venundatis] When property captured in war was
sold, a spear was set up. No doubt owing to this custom a spear was
erected at auctions and in the Centumviral Court, which dealt chiefly
with cases relating to inheritance of prope1·ty; cf. Cic. de qffi 2. 8. 29 and
especially Gaius 4. 16: Festuca autem alebantur quasi hastae loco, szssgrno
quodam iuslz' (hminis, (quod maxime) sua esse credebant quae ex hostibus
cqlu‘sscazt: unde in centumviralibus iudiciis hasta propom'lur3 cf. also
24. 18. 11 z convenere frequentes, qm· haslae huius generis adsueverant.

4 auro] See 5. 50. 7, and cf. 5. 25. 8-10. It is said that the Roman
matrons provided srom their ornaments the gold requisite sor an offering
to Apollo, and also sor the ransom paid to the Gauls. In return, they
received the right of riding in carriages in the city and of the laudatio at
their fuiierals.

6 ἓ 3. ante capitolium incensum] The original temple (said to have
been dedicated in 509 B.C.) was burnt down in 83 B.C., during, though
not immediately in consequence of, the Sullan wars; cf. Tac. Hist. 3. 72:
arserat et ante Capt'lolz'mn civili bello, sed fraude privata. This is the
conllagration to which Livy here refers. The site of the temple of
Jupiter Capitolinus has now been definitely located on the southern or
lower eminence of the Mons Capitolinus3 on the northern eminence was
the Arx, and between the two was the depression known as inter duos
lucos. See map.

in‘lovis cella,..ante pedes Iunonis] Cf. c. ²9· 9. The temple was
divided into three shrines (cellae) by parallel walls. The central cella
belonged to Jupiter, whose seated statue was placed there ς the W. cella
contained a standing statue of Minerva, the E. one of Juno; cf. the coins
figured in Ramsay, Roman Antiquizrksffi, p. 41, and the description in
Dionysius of the temple as restored by Catulus (69 B.c.): ἐν αὐτῷ τρεῖς
σηκοὶ παράλληλοι, κοινὰς ἔχοντες πλευράς, μέσος μὲν ὀ τοῦ Διός, παρ’
ἑκάτερον δὲ τὸ μέρος ὅ τε τῆς ’Ήρας καὶ ὸ τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς ὑφ’ ἑνὸς ἀετοῦ
(pediment) καὶ μιᾶς στέγης καλυπτόμενοι. The question arises, How
could these paterae have been placed in the cella os Jupiter and yet before
the seet of Juno’s statue? The explanation that there was a statue of Juno
in the cella of Jupiter seems an improbable one in the face of the above
evidence. Most probably Livy here uses in Iovis cella loosely for in
lovis templo, and the paterae were placed in the chamber of Juno. That
Livy was not very carel'ul to maintain the distinction between [emplum
and cella is shown by a passage in 7. 3. 5: fixa fuit (lex) dextro lateri
aedis lovis optimi maximi, ex qua parle Minervae templum est. Here
