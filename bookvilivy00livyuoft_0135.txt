CHM’TER XIV.

26 §L minime dubius] For the constr. with acc. and inf„ see
c. 12. 2 n.

27 bellum...patres iussuros] Once more Livy is careless as regards
coiist'itutional details. In c. 22. 4 lic is inore accurate: cx senatus
consulto populique iussn bellum Praenestinis inzliclum. The final word
as to peace and war lay with the Cantilia Cenluriala.

28 moles] ‘ trouble‚’ cf. c. 2. 11 n.

30 ἓ 2. non enim...intuenti erant] ‘sor hy this time (iam) not merely
the specches of M. Manlius, but his actions also, though ill appearance
designed to gain popiilarity, seemed sraught with revolution, when their
true intent was considered)

Hitherto (c. 11. 7) Manlius had confined himself to speeches3 he
now began to put his ideas as to the relations between creditor and
debtor into practice. Eadem brings ont the contrast between the
appearance and the reality.

31 intuenti] This dat. of the pres. part. seems to be an imitation ol
tlie Gk constr.; cf. Tliuc. 2. 49. 5: τῷ μὲν ἔξωθεν ἁπτομένῳ σῶμα οὑκ
ἄγαν θερμὸν ἦν. Lit. ‘to one considei·ing,‘ ‘to oiie toucliiiig.' The
constr. becomes frequent in Livy and Tacittis; cf. 7. 10. 6: nequaquam
visu ac specie aestimantibus pares. See Appendix.

5² ἓ 3. nobilem] ‘renowned.‘

iudicatum pecuniae cum duci vidisset] The man liad been sormally
lianded over to his creditor to be sold into slavery, cf. c. ii. 811. The
words iudicatum pet-mnae refer to the first step in the process, that
denoted by the rebus iure indiculis of the XII Tables, by which the
debtor was judicially ordered to make payment. Livy, as liis woiit is,
passes over the intermediate stages—the triginta ‹t'z'es t'usli, the sixty
days’ imprisoninent, the proclaniatioii on the three nundinae, and de-
scribes the moment when the debtor lias been finally delivered over to
the creditor. Cs. below, ἕ io.

Ι). 19. 1. pecuniae] Gen. of the penalty, as aster damnare in the.
phrase damnare capitis. Perhaps originally the gen. depended upon
some such word as iudicio.

2 manum intecit] Not to be confused with the legis actio per manus
iniectionem, by which a desaulting debtor was sumniarily arrested. The
meaning here is apparently as follows 2—-Thc debtor being condemned
was iii the position os a slave, so Manlius came sorward as vindex, and
