η 5 4. elevando...colleg·ae] ‘seeking to impair the influence os his
colleague in the only way he could—on the ground of age.’ For the abl.
of the gerund=pres. part„ cf. c. το. 8: aequando.

14 §5. cunctatorem] again reminds us of Fabius, unns qui nohis
cunctando restituis rem (Aen. 6. 846, modelled on a line of Ennius).

ex] See c. 4. 5n.

16 rapere] ‘to capture swiftly‚’ ‘to seize.’ There is no necessity to
adopt capere, the reading of the inferior MSS. Rapere, usually simply
‘to plunder,' here implies swist assault and capture; it is a much more
graphic word than capere, though perhaps no precise parallel to its
present sense can be cited; cf.‚ however, Lucan 6. 14: praeceps rapiendas
tendit ad arcis. See Appendix.

residem] ‘remaining idly.’ The word is not found in Cicero or
Caesar. In ¹2. 32. 5: residem in urbe plebem, it is used in the simple
sense of ‘remaining,' from which the further idea os sluggishness is
easily developed.

18 ἓ 6. tempus] ‘favourable moment’; cf. the common in tempore:
‘at the right time?

19 mstruendis] See Appendix.

ἓ ¹7. frigere ac torpere] The qualities properly belonging to the
old man's body are transferred to his mind. Cf. Scott, Lay of the Last
Minstrel, α. 30:

‘My hairs are grey, my limbs are old,
My heart is dead, my veins are com)
Also Byron, Clzilde Harold 3. 8:

‘Years steal Ι Fire from the mind as vigour from the limbss

ἰο quid attfflere...paffl] ‘what point was there in allowing?' The
question is rhetorical, and really=a neg. statement, non affluere.

29 ξ 0. negare...neque...neque] ef. c. 16. 3¹¹· The negatives are not
mutually destructive, when, as here, ‘the first neg. is general and is
followed by several subordinate members each with a neg.' See Roby,
Syntax‚ ἕ 2246.

33 ς ιο. collegae imperium se non posse impedire] It was with a
view to avoiding the collision os the equal imperia of the consuls that
a dictator was appointed at times of national danger. In ²¹7 B.c. the
nomination of Minucius to act as dictator as well as Fabius completely
frustrated the purpose of the office, which lapsed after the Second Punic
War. The imperium was always regarded as one and indivisible, a view
based upon the character of the kingly imperium. When both consuls
were in the city, they arranged that the initiative in public business
