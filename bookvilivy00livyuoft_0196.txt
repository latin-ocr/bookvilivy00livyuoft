and that it would be in accordance with the merit of the irnrnortal gods
that sudi maximi should take place‚' etc.

ludi maximi] These were the garnes which became known as the
luds Romani. Their foundation is attributed by Livy to Tarquinius
Priscus, in celebration of a victory over the Latins; cf. 1. 35. 10:
solemnes deinde annui mansere ludi, Romani magnique varie appellati.

Prof. Mommsen, however, has shown (Rbm. Forsclz. 2. pp. 42 ff.) that in “

all probability the games were originally held merely from time to time
as the result of vows made by successful generals (ludi votivi, cf.‚ e.g.,
4. 27. 1), and that subsequently, very possibly on the present occasion,
they became the annual ludi Romani, which by Cicero's time lasted
from the 5th to the 19th of September. These gamos were closely
bound up with the worship of Jupiter, the central point of the festival
being formed by the epulum lovis on the 13th (the ides). September
was the natural month for celebrating successes gained in war, for, as
a rule, it marked the close of the summer campaigns. Cf. Warde
F owler, T lte Roman E’stz‘vals, pp. 215 ff.

9 ἕ 18. recusantibus] This explanation of the origin of the curule
aedileship can scarcely be correct, since the,cost of the games would at
this time be practically covered by the state allowance, extravagant
expenditure on the part of the aediles being characteristic of later
Republican times only.v The patricians seem to have seized the
opportunity of gaining two more magistracies for themselves in return
for the plebeian consulship.

12 ut] To be taken closely with id: ‘they would gladly become
aediles sor the sake of honouring the immortal gods.’ XVeiss. takes id
as referring to munus and ut as: ‘ on condition that.’

¹3 ξς 14. senatus consultum] Livy⁷s language might lead us to sup-
pose that the curule aedileship was founded by decree of the senate;
this is unlikely. Probably a resolution of the people was passed
creating the magistracy, and then the senate directed the dictator to
hold the elections.

¹4 dictator populum rogaret] i.e. he held the elections in his capacity
of supreme magistrate. The Curule Aediles were elected by the
Comitia Tre'bula. The next year (cf. 7. 1. 6) it was agreed that they
should be chosen from patricians and plebeians in alternate years, and
this custom continued for a considerable time. The work of the new
aediles was much the same as that of the plebeian aediles3 besides the cura
(mim-ivn, they had charge of the police of the city and of the corn supply.
