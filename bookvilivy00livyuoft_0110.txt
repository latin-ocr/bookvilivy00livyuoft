625 LIVY. Vl. [11§6

centuriaret] ‘formed into centu1·ies’; cf. Cic. ad All. 16. 9: rem
geri! palam, centuriat Carpuac, dinumerat.

24 ξ ’1. trifariam] Not found before Livy ; cf. Gk τριφάσιος.

29 ξε. acl Mecium] Diodorus (¹4· 117. 1) says: ἐν τῷ καλουμένῳ
Ῐιίαρκίῳ κατεστρατοπέδευσαν, ἀπέχοντες ἀπὸ Ῥώμης σταδίους &anacteum
cf. Plut. Cam. 34: περὶ τὸ Μάρκιον ὅρος. No doubt the tribus Maecia
founded in 33² nc. derived its name from the same source as the present
place, perhaps from some conspicuous hill, as Plutarch's language
suggests. The MSS. vary with regard to the name; see Appendix.

30 ἓ 9. ab] Here practically=pr0pter‚ giving the motive of the
action. Cf. c. 4. 8: ab odio.

3¹ crederent] By a curious usage the word introducing the or. obliqua
is itself put into the subjunctive. We might have expected quod
...credebant 3 there is no logical justification for using the subjunctive
crcab'ent. The constr., however, is found elsewhere in Latin3 cf. 21. 1. 3
and Cic. de off. 1. 13. 40: rediit paulo post, quod se oblitum nescio quid
dicerem e. 6. 5 is not parallel, since dicerent there occurs in true or.
obliqua.

32 audituS...] ⁵ The news that Camillus was in command’; cf.
c. 1. 1 n.

33 vallum] This was properly the palisade (valli= Gk χάρακες), which
crowned the outer edge of the earthwork (agger) ; but vallum is frequently
used sor the earthwork itself, as here. ’

p. 4. 4 § u. aperuit...viam] The enemy had erected a barricade of
logs outside the earth-mound. Camillus set fire to this barricade, the
smoke from which blew into the faces of the defenders and threw them
into confusion 3 but the Romans themselves found considerable difficulty
in crossing the glowing embers.

5 vapore] Very likely means ‘heat’ here, as always in Lucretius:
cf. 5. 48. 2: loco...ab incendiis torrida et vaporis pleno. It may of
course bear the more usual meaning of ‘ steam‚' ‘ vapour.’

6 moles] ‘ trouble! Moles means originally ‘ mass,’ and then ‘trouble‚'
‘effort,’ cf. Verg. Aen. ι. 33: Tantae molis erat Romanam condere
gentem. With this may be compared the English ‘ moil ’ in the phrase
‘toil and moil,’ etc. Cf. Bacon, Essay ‘of Plantations’: ‘but moile not

too much under ground‚' although the connection between moles and
moil is disputed by philologists.

ῑ mffltlbus munitum] See Appendix.
10 ἓ 12. militi] Collective singular: ‘ soldiers.’ Livy makes a very
extensive use of these collective singular-s. Besides words like eque5,
