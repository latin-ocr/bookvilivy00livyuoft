86 LJVY. Vl. [X1§3

Am'mi is really a locative, as in the phrases pendere animi, suspensus
am'mi. By salse analogy the constr. was extended to real genitives,
e.g. Tac. Hist. 3. 75: sermonis nimius.

alios]=ceteros‚ as frequently in Livy.

13 esse] There seems to be no occasion to omit esse as Madvig does;
Camillus’ moral influence was so great that in rhetorical language he
was said to hold sole sway in the army, to be virtual, if not actual,
dictator: cf. c. 6. 16: Μ. Furium sibi pro dictatore...fulm’unu The
or. obliqua is continued aster aegrefhrcbat. See Appendix.

14 iisdem auspiciis creatos] i.e. had been elected under the presidency
of, and returned by, the same magistrate, who had consulted the will os
the gods by taking the auspices. The whole system of Roman magis-
tracies was a collegiate one and specially designed to prevent the undue
prominence os any individual.

15 ἓ 4. cum interim] ‘ while all the time‚’ practically concessive. De-
pendent upon these words are poluerit, aggressus sit, depulerit, sit, and
(irregularly) esse at the end of the sentence. For the sudden change
from subj. to inf„ cf. c. 27. 6, where we find cum interim..-.obiectan',
though the natural constr. would have been the subj. 3 Ltb. in the present
case adopts the conjectural reading esse constet. Si...vel2·t is parenthetic:
‘if only men would weigh things truly.'

¹7 potuerit] Potuit (in this case the subj. potuerit) is regularly used in
unsulfilled conditions sor potuisset. Parallel is the use of the perf. ind.
of verbs expressing duty, and os gerundives and comparatives with fuit:
cf. Cic. pro Mil. 22. 58: quos nisi manumisisset, tormentis eliam-dedendi
suerunt; cf. also Juv. 10. 1²3 Antoni poluit gladios conlemnere, si sic!
omm'a darisset.

18 ἓ 5. inter-...solutis animis] Note the variety of constr.; trans.
‘while they were receiving the gold, and after their attention had been
relaxed through expectation of peace.’ For the gerundival constr. after
inter, cf. c. 39. 10 inm* accspiendas...rogationes. Such constructions are
not found in strict classical prose writers.

in spem] In with the acc. denotes the direction ,towards which
their minds tumed.

ρο pars virilis] ‘ a due share'3 cf. the common pro parte virili, ‘as far as
a man can.' ⁴

apud] More regularly, penes. Cf. 2. 24. 2 : ulpmes eosdem pericula
belli, penes quos praemia essent.

23 ξ 6.’ ad hoc] ‘in addition to this.'

impotens]:7mn potem sui, ‘lacking in sels-control)
