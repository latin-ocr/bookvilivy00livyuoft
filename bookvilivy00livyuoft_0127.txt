xi ᾗ 3] ΝΟ TES. 85

ιο 5 8. unde]=a quibus.
suae potestatis esse] possessive gen.. very similar to hostium
above.

13 ἓ 4. postquam...erat] The normal constr. after poslquam is the
perf. indic. Livy frequently uses the imperf„ sometimes (though not in
this case) to denote the commencement osa state or action z cf. c. ¹3· 3,
postquam...quisque...cernebat, ¹ when each began to perceive.’ llere
postquam simply = quia.

23 ξ 6. res repetitae] ‘satisfaction was demandcd.’ lx‘rfetcre is used
of demanding back things uulawsully appropriated; cs. lex repelundarum
sc. pecuniarwn, which was a law providing sor the recovery of wealth
illegally extorted by a provincial governor.

²4 ex instituto] i.e. in accordance with the ternis of the treaties made
by Cassius.

28 ἓ 8. ils] See Appendix.

²9 terrorem...a. Volscis] a here indicates the source os the apprehension;
cf. below, c. ιι. 2: bellum ab Volscis, which shows clearly how this use
of a has arisen. In the latter case ortum is to be supplied srom the
preceding exorta. So here aster terrorem some such word as ortum
must be supplied mentally.

30 adhaerentem lateri] The dat. is poetical. Cicero uses in with abl.
For the phrase, cf. Verg. Aen. 4. 73: lmem‘l lateri letalis harundo.

3¹ ξ 9. quae relata...11abere] ‘this answer‚ when brought to the
Senate, seemed to fail to affor-d an opportunity, rather than a ground,
sor war‚' i.e. the answer os the Latius was so unsatisfactory that it might
have been made a rasus belli, but the Romans were not prepared for
immediate hostilities. The order tends to make the sentence somewhat
obscure; non must be taken closely with habete.

CHAPTER XI.

p, 15. 5 ἓ 1. C. Sergio iterum] These words are omitted in the
MSS„ but are almost certainly to be supplied here, since the name os
another consular tribune is required, and in c. 27. ἰ C. Sergius is
consular tribune sor the third time, though his second year of office is
nowhere else mentioned. The omission was no doubt brought about by
the fact that the scribe hadjust written &erum aster Cursore3 as a result
he passed over the second ilerum with the name preceding it.

ιο § 2. Μ. Manlio capitolino] Cf. c. 5. 611. For a general review of
the story of M. Manlius, see Introd. ξ 4 e.

ἓ 3. nimius animi] Lit. ‘intemperate in spirit,' so ‘liaughty.'
