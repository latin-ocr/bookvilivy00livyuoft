136 LIVY. VI. [xxxv ᾗ 6

7 publicis ‘privatisque consiliis] i.e. in the senate and at informal
meetings.

9 rogationes] Cf. leges, above, in ξ 4. Both terms are used for
⁴ bills,‘ but rogatio accurately describes the procedure. The magistrate
aslecd the people sor their assent to the proposal (velitis iubentis, Qui-
ritas ?), which only became law after that assent had been given.

10 ἕ ’1. tribus] The assembly was the exclusively plebeian concilium
plebis, which voted by tribes. The reason why the patricians did not
rely upon (leseating the bill by the withholding of the senatus auctoritas
was clearly that they preferred to use the plebeian weapon against the
plebs. This would serve at once to draw off part of the odium from
themselves, and to sow dissensions among their opponents.

ιε recitari] Interesting as showing the practical application of the
veto. The tribune who interposed his veto forbade the clerk to read

out the contents of the bill; disobedience to this order would be

regarded as an ofsence against the tribunician sacrosanctz'tas3 cf. Ascon.

in Cornel. p. 58: P. &avilius Globulus tribunus plebz's...ubi legis fe-

marlae dies venit et praeco subiciente scriba verba legis recitare populo

coepit, et scribam subit-ere et praeconem pronuntiare passus non est.
sollemne] eg. anelare tribus in szff‘agimn.

13 ad sciscendum plebi] Plebi is probably dat. after solemne, ‘usual
for the plebs in passing resolutions! XVeiss„ however, takes ad sc. pl.
together, ‘ usual for the passing of a resolution by the plebs)

¹4 ga. pro antiquatis] ‘virtually rejected,' because the plebs never
had a chance of accepting the proposals. Antiquam rogationem is the
opposite of iubere rog. On the voting tablets V. R. (zuti rogas) in-
dicated approbation of a measure, A. (=antiqu0) rejection. The word
is explained as :antiqua probo, ‘ Ι prefer the old state of things.'

15 bene habet] Colloquial: ⁶ very g00d‚² implying a threat.

¹7 ξ 9. agite dum] Dum is here an enclitic; cf. the Gk. δή in φέρε
δή, ἄγε δή. This use is very frequent in Plautus and T erence3 dum is
probably an aec. of time. *Somewhat parallel is our ‘ wait a while,' ‘wait
a bit)

18 faxo] Another sorrn frequent in the comie' poets, and used here
colloquially. It is explained as :fecero in sense, though in formation
it is an old aor. subj. Here it is simplyzan emphatic suture3 cf.
c. 41. 12: saxilis.

veto] The technical word is interced03 cf. c. 38. 5. Livy is
notoriously inaccurate in such matters, and though we find a similar
meaning of vetate in 3. 13. 6, the modern use os the word ‘velo' has a
very slcnder foundation to rest upon.
