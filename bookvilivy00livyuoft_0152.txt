110 LIVY. Vl. [xx§11

⁴22 esset] The suhj. expresses purpose: the obiect of the change was
to avoid the sight of the Capitol.

concilium populi] The expression is inaccurate. The assemblies

of the populus, i.e. of the whole citizen body, patricians and plebeians

alike, were always called comitia, those of the plebs by itself concilia.

There can be little doubt that Livy, wh0‚ as we have seen (ἓ 5), attaches

small weiglit to accuracy in these matters, really means the Comitia ,

C ι nutriata.

24 ἓ 12. sunt, qui] We do not know who these authorities were, but
in all probability they included the earlier and better annalists, such as
Fabius and Piso. This alternative account was the one given by Nepos
(ap Gell. ¹7· 21. 24): ut Cornelius Nepos scrzplnm reliquit verberando
mealm- cst, i.e. he was put to death more maimmn, as the result os
condemnation by duumviri perduellionis.

duumviros] The more correct term was duumviri perduellionis
india-ambre. They were commissionem specially appointed to try men
accused of the crime of jerdnellio, or high treason. Only three cases
of trial by duumviri pauluelle'onis are known, consequently details of
procedure are very uncertain. In the case of Horatius (Ι. 26), the
commissioners were nominated by the King; in that of Rabirius (63 13.c.),
when an obsolete form of procedure was revived, they were chosen
by lot.

τ 5 anquirerent] Legal term, ‘to hold a trial,' used os the prosecuting
magistrate in a iudicium populi. It is osten found with capitis or
pet-unici, denoting the punishment demanded by the accuser.

auctores sint] ‘relate’

v26 de saxo Tarpeio] Throwing from the Tarpeian rock appears to
have been the punishment specially inflicted by the tribunes os the
plebs, since they had no lictors assigned to them. See map.

28 ἓ 13. notae] ‘marks of ignominy’; cs. the well-known nola
censoria. ‚

29 Monetae] The temple of Juno Moneta was vowed by L. Furius
Camillus (7. 28. 4) and dedicated on June rst 344 B.c. The name
silonem is probably connected with moneo, and is perhaps reminiscent
of the warning of the approach of the Gauls given by the sacred birds
os Juno. Part of the temple was used as a mint, with the result that
moneta subsequently came to mean ‘a mint’ and ‘money.’ Suidas
(s.v. Μονήτα) says that this name was given to the goddess, and the
mint attached to her temple, on account of her good advice in the war
against Pyrrhus. Later on another temple was dedicated to Juno
