character with this one, and Appian (Bellum Civile 1. 7) says that
the law of Gracchus was the revival of an earlier one, which
according to Plutarch (Tib. Gracc-72. 8) only remained in force
for a short time. It is contended that this law referred to by
Appiam must be the one attributed to Licinius and Sextius,
but nevertheless cannot possibly have been passed as far back
as 367 B.C.; in all probability it should be dated at about 180 Rc.
Another argument is that the Licinian law clearly supposes
that a considerable number of persons occupied more than
500 iugem each3 such a supposition would be utterly irre-
concilable with the extent of Roman territory at the earlier
date, and points to a time when Rome was practically mistress
of the whole of Italy. If once the genuineness of the agrarian
law is made doubtful, the other laws must inevitably be viewed
with considerable suspicion. Prof. Pais thinks that the consul-
ship may have been opened to the plebs about 367 B.C., but
that the provision for the relies of debtors and the admission
of plebeians to share the eustody of the Sibylline Books are
both to be referred to a considerably later date.

Though it cannot be denied that there is no slight weight
in the above argumentS, it may yet be fairly maintained
that they only point to an exaggeration of the provisions of
the agrarian law of 367 B.C. and do not entirely invalidate it.
We have seen above (p. xxiii.) that there must have been wide-
spread distress after the Gallie invasion and that there were
repeated agitations to secure the distribution of land3 cf. c. 5. 4:
nobiles homines in possessionem agri publici grassari, nec, nisi,
antequam omnia praecipiant, divisus sil, locum ibi plebi sore.
We have seen too (ξ 4 b) that Rome, in the years covered by
the narrative of this book, gained substantial additions to her
territory. It may therefore have very well been that a law was
passed to restrict the amount of land that could be occupied
by any individual, not indeed to 500 iugera—the number may
easily have been altered under the influence of the later law—
but to a degree which better accords with the extent of the
Roman territory at this timel. It is to be noted that Livy

¹ Perhaps the maximum was 100 iugera, the amount given by the
writer of the dc viris inluslm'lms, 20.
