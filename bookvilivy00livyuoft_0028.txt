trustworthy‚ a clear view of the progress of the Roman arms
abroad can be obtained from these chapters. These external
relations of the city may be discussed under three heads, as
they concern respectively (1) the Etruscans, (2) the Volscians,
and (3) the Latins and Hernicans.

(1) 'l'he Etruscans. By the capture of Veii (v. 21) the
immediate danger which threatened Rome from the North was
removed, but though the district bordering on the N. bank os the
Tiber was now in Roman possession, there was always a way
open to their Etruscan enemieS, so long as the Ciminian Forest,
the natural boundary between Northern and Southern Etruria,
remained unsecured. The tightening of the grip of Rome upon
Southern Etruria is recorded in the present book. The terrible
Gallie disaster had naturally inspired those Etruscans who had
been conquered with the hope of recovering their independence.
But their effort was crushed (c. 3), and the permanent character
of the Roman success is clearly indicated by the establishment
of four new tribes in the conquered territory, one os these being
located in the district surrounding the Lacus Sabalz'nm and the
others, in all probability, in the neighbourhood of Veii and Falerii
(c. 4. 4 and c. 5. 8). But the work of settlement could not be
regarded as complete till the two towns of Sutrium and Nepete,
‘the gates of Et1·uria,' which commanded the passes between
the North and the South, were occupied by Latin colonies.
The alliance with these towns had proved unsatisfactory (cc. 3,

“ 9, and 10), and we are not snrprised to find Livy recording the

foundation of a colony at Nepete in 383 Rc. (c. 21. 4), while
Velleius Paterculus (1. 14), though not agreeing with Livy as to
dates, mentions the foundation of another colony at Sutrium
about this time. These steps may be regarded as indicating the
complete reduction of S. Etruria, a task in which the Romans
were no doubt considerably assisted by the pressure which was
being put upon the Etruscan seaports by Dionysius 1., the
tyrant of Syracuse, who during this period sacked the temple of
Pyrgi, the arsenal of Caere (Diod. 15. 14).

(2) The Volscians, In spite of the confused nature of the
accounts of the Volscian wars given by Livy, it may yet be
clearly discerned that the Romans were making substantial
