qua...auditis] ‘wherein you so gladly hear our colleagues agreeing.’
So we must translate, if the qua of the Mss. is retained. For this
absolute use of concinere: ‘to agree‚' cf. Cic. N. D. 1. 7. 16 ε Stoici cnm
Peripateticis re concinere via'mtur, verbis ‹liscmpara See Appeiide.

28 ἓ 10. per quinquennium] This period of five years without curule
magistrates is generally regarded as an impossibly long one. It is true
that it is supported by the Faslz' consulares, but on the other hand,
Zonaras (i.e. Dio Cassius) gives the time as four years„ Diodorus (15.
75. ι), as only oue. The tiuth seems to be that tlie solando magis-
traluum was a device to set the Fasti straight.

30 ἓ 1. esset] oblique, expressing the thought of the colonists.

3² ξ 2. novis civibus] Cf. c. 26. Sn.

p. 49. 1. verecundia] Abl. z ‘with a feeling of sliame.⁷

5 §3- per interregem] Because, owing to the solitudo magt'slra-
tuum, there was no consul or consular tribune to hold the elections;
cf. c. 1. 5n.

14 §a exppgnari] It is significant of the unreality of these wars
and sieges that Livy forgets to tell us what happened to Velitrae.
Plutarch (Cam. 42) says that it surrendered to Camillus during his last
campaign: τὴν ’γὰρ Οὐελιτρανῶν πόλιν εἶλεν ἐν παρέργῳ ταύτης τῆς
στρατείας ἀμαχεὶ προσχωρήσασαν αὐτῷ. It is very probable, as Weiss.
suggests, that this war against Velitrae was an invention to account for
the delay in passing the Licinio-Sextian proposals.

27 ξ 7. auctor] ‘ prompter! lle had suggested the course adopted by
Licinius and Sextius; suasorem: ‘ advocate.’

28 se...ferebat] ‘declared himself '; cf. prae se ferre, which means
‘ to assert.'

g 8. cum] ‘whereas ' 3 concessive.

30 ut terme solent qui a suis desciscunt] This dietum of Livy’s is
hardly borne out by history. Renegades have usually proved the most
active and bitter opponents of the cause they have deserted5 cf„ c.g.,
Labienus against Caesar.

capti et. stupentes animi] ‘weakened and dazed in mind.’ Animi
is really a locatim, as in pendere animi. We find captus animi in Tac.
Hist. 3. 73, but the more usual expression is captus mente. For capio

ι in this sense, cs. the common captus oculis, ‘ blind!
