xxxiv LI V Y VI.

magistratus capessendos ullo viro acri experientique animus
essee( This wealthy class of plebeians is represented by
Licinius and Sextius themselveS, and the story of the condem-
nation of Licinius for the contravention of his own land law
is persectly true, if it is regarded as a revelation of their real
aims and interests (7. 16. 9). So too Livy represents the
poorer plebeians as wishing to carry through the laws relating
to debt and the occupation of the ager publicus without the
one concerning the consulship (c. 39. 2) Í¾ they had no practical
interest in the high offices of state. But this combination of
all ranks among the plebeians proved of great advantage to
Rome, for on the one hand political unity was assured by the
creation of a new nobility drawn from both patricians and
plebeiam, while on the other a temporary relies at least was
gained sor the poorer sarmers. The breaking down of patrician
monopoly in the control of religion was begun by the opening
of a sacred college to plebeians, an event of even more import-
ance in its promise for the future than in the immediate
advantage derived. Livy has given us in his graphic account
of the Licinio-Sextiam laws and the strife connected with them
an epitome of the inner life of Rome at this time, and though
what he has written may not be perfectly trustworthy in its
details, it is yet in a broad sense truly historical.
