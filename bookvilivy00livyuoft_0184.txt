dictatorship; cf. 9. 26. 12: ipsos adeo dictatorem rtzcrgrt'stralzcrttqzte
equilum reos veagis quam quaesitores eius criminis esse, intellecturosque
id csse, simul magistratu abissent.

quingentum mulum] i.e. 500,000 pounds os uneoined copper (aes
rude). The amount is absurdly large, and Livy implies his disbelief in
this veision of the story. Probably the heavy bronze coinage (aes
‹rravr ) was not yet in existence, it being now supposed that it only dates
fmm the middle of the 4th century Β. C. See Hill, Greek and Roman
C01‘‚11s p. 45. Before that time the copper was simply weighed out as
occasion required, as in the ceremony per aes et libram. The point,
however, must not here be pressed, since the question as to whether
coined money existed at this time or not was not likely to occur to
Livy’s mind.

ξ 10. auspiciis] Livy is inclined to believe the first version of the
story, viz. that there had been some flaw in Camillus’ appointment.
Plutarch, however (Cam. 39) says that Camillus resigned from sear os
the threats, though feigning ill health: ταῖς δ’ ἑξῆς ἡμέραις σκηψάμενος
ἀρρωστεῖν ἐξωμόσατο τὴν ἀρχήν. This would be unworthy of Livy’s
hero.

η ξ 11. haud. sine pudore. . repetiturum] ‘ since he would have been
ashamed to resume....'

¹5 §12 in ordinem cogi] ‘humiliated'; cf. our ‘to reduce to the
ranks) In 3. 35. 6 the phrase is used of sels· abasement. Plin. Ep.

1. 2 3 uses in ordznem cogi in reference to the tribuneship‘ being brought

into contempt)

§la The general sense is: If Camillus (as some asserted) had
been driven by the tribunes to resign, 'the latter would certainly have
been strong enough to carry through their proposals at once 3 this was
contrary to known facts. ’

¹9 dictaturae...fuit] ‘the dignity of the dictatorship was always the
higher one.‘ Yet the passages quoted above (ἓ 9n.) show that Livy
gives other instances of collisions between tribunes and dictator. The

present meaning of faslzgn'um should be compared with that in c. 20. 8.

CHAPTER XXXIX.

²0 ἓ 1. dictaturam abdicatam] The constr. abdicare magistratum
is occasionally used by Livy, as here and in c. 18. 4. The Ciceronian
consti-sis always abdicare se ftzcrgislrzrl21‚ and this is also more usual
in Livy.
