sent out to pasture. Now had this system been carried out
strictly, the result should have been fairly satisfactory 3 but the
temptation to turn their monopoly of government to their own
advantage proved too strong for the patricians. A tacit agree—
ment seems to have been arrived at between them and the
richer plebeians, whereby as little arable land as possible was
distributed in allotments. The state in theory retained the
ownership (domz'm‘mn), but the rich were allowed to settle on
(occupare) the land and to draw large revenues from it by means
of their command of capital and, consequendy, of labour. A
small percentage of the profits was due to the state by way of
rent, but even this payment was frequently evaded. The rich
also monopolised the pasture lands with their flocks and their
herds‚ with the result that the small landowner, who stood in
greatest need of help, found himself thrust out at every point.
This position of affairs enables us to understand the reasons
for the agrarian agitations which meet us constantly in this book
and which culminate in the great Licinio—Sextian rogations. We
find that the tribunes first tried to rouse the people to put
forward a demand for the distribution of the ager Pomptinus,
the district lying to the S. of the Alban Mount, which, after
being rescued from the hands of the Volscians, had evidently
been taken in occupation by rich patricians. At first the
prospect of lands without any adequate means of stocking them
caused but little enthusiasm among the plebeians; but as the
all-important task of rebuilding Rome grew lighter, they sup-
ported the proposal with greater readiness (c. 5. 1 ff. and
c. 6. 1). In *385 B.C. the Senate attempted to assuage the
popular discontent by agrant of land at Satricum in this district,
but the meagre character of the distribution defeated the object
with a view to which it was made (c. 16. 6, 7). Two years later
there was another attempt to win over the plebeians by the division
of the whole of the agchompll'mts into allotments (c. 21. 4); the
colonies of Sutrium, Nepete, and Setia, though doubtless planted
primarily for military purposes, mayalso have served as a
temporary check to the prevailing discontent. But it was a
change in the entire system which was required, and an effort,
ultimately unsuccessful it is true, was made in this direction by
