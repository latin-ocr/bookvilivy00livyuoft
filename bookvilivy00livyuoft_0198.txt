156 LJVY. Vs.

proditus, comparing, among other passages, 4. 4 3. 9: poslremo L. Papirius
lllugl'lanas proditus interrex. lterum, as Weiss. says, probably came
in from the following line.

ξ 11. rei num] The reading os P, adopted by Mdg. VM read
rei nullius, which Weiss. followed, interpreting thus: rei nullius agendae
is explanatory of inszgnem, ‘they made the day distinct, i.e. a day of

doing nothing.’ H.J. M. and Ltb. adopt Freudenberg's conj. religione ’

rei ullius, ⁴ they distinguished the day by religious scruple against doing
anything.' Ltb., however, (after T. Faber) suggests that re nulla...
agenda may be the true reading.

2 ἓ 3. defectionis] From V, which has adedesectiom's. The other
MSS. (according to H. J. M.) read defeslz'onz‘. Ltb. and Zingerle,
however, say they read desertione, and adopt this in their text.

§8. Mecium] VP. M meslz'um. Another MS. metium.

ἓ 11. militibus munitum] Supplied by V only, and generally
adopted by edd. It might, however, very well be a scribe's insertion
to bring out the point of the sentence more clearly.

3 § 5. ante moenia, patentes portas] Ltb. reads ante patentes portas
after V.
ἐ 7. portas] Mdg. would omit the second portas.
4 ἕ 8. relinquerent] The MSS.; except V, which has relinqueretur.
The latter reading is adopted by H. J. M., Ltb., and Zingerle.
5 ἓ 3. habuerint] Mdg. MSS. habuerunt.
ξ 5. moverunt] Mdg. M ¹ moverent, M2 moverant, P moverat.
eodem] MSS. Ascensius‚ followed by ΙΙ. J. M., would read eandem.
Ltb. aster XVesenberg omits eodem. Can tempore have fallen out?
6 ἕ 5. voluntarios] Bracketed by Mdg. as a gloss.
ξ 7. in animo] MSS.; except V, which hasid animo. Wolfflin
ammo.

ξ 8. dictatorem] MSS. Bracketed by Mdg. Weiss. suggested
z'mperalorem. .

honorato] V. Other MSS. honoratum. Aldus honoralorum.

ἓ 13. ad. urbem] V. Other MSS. in urbe.

ἓ 14. alia belli] V. P belli alia, M belli alia.

ἓ 16. in partem] V. Other MSS. in partes, which might be right.

'1 ἓ 2. restitantes] Gronovius. MSS. resistentes, which is by no

means impossible.

§4- et Aequ1s] MSS. Heusinger, followed by Ltb., ex Aequis.
lt is true that the reading of the MSS. would, taken strictly, imply that
the victory had been gained over a united soree of Volscians and Aequians.
