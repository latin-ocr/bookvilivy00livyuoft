obscrve that he regards as of little account sor the historiari
that vast source of information which has enabled us to learn
so much about even Assyria and Egypt, as well as of the early
history os Greece and Rome—the evidence of the monuments.
Α thorough search must have revealed much that was valuable
cven for the history of Rome before the burning of the city by the
Gauls, but Livy is content to say that practically everything of
value pei-ished in that conflagration. Nor does he appear to have
made much use of archaeological evidence after 390 B.c.; laws
and treaties engraved on stone and bronze, inscriptions set up in
private houses, lists of magistrates, so invaluable for chronology‚
all these are practically neglected. Even on those rare occasions
when Livy mentions an inscription or a monument in support
of his statements too much reliance must not be placed on his
accuracy. Thus there is grave reason to doubt the genuineness
of the inscription said to have been placed beneath the statue
dedicated by T. Quinctius Cincinnatus in the temple of Jupiter
on the Capitol (c. 29. 10). On the other hand we are enabled to
correct Livy by means of an elogium of Camillus, i.e. an in-
scription, no doubt set up by some member of the gens Furia,
on which were recorded that hero's principal exploits (C. I. L. l.
p. 285). The inscription says. Etruscis ad Sutrium devictis,
Aequis et Volscis subactis, tertium triumphavit (this bears out the
account given by Livy in cc. 2-4 under the year 389 B-C.), and
then goes on: quart(um) se(vere in) Velz'tern(os animadvertit).
The last statement must refer to Camillus' 4th consular tribunate
in 386 B.C.‚ but there is no mention of the series of victories
over Volscians, Latius, Hernicans⁷ and Etruscans described by
Livy in cc. 6—10. This confirms what would on other grounds
be probable, viz. that Livy has simply related the same campaigns
twice over. Everything seems to show that Livy was not anxious
to investigate personally the ground of many of his statements3
even the libri lintei in the temple of Iuno Moneta (cf. 4. 7. 12)
do not appear to have been consulted by him at first hand.

We may next enquire what historians Livy consulted in
writing book Vl. It is indeed impossible to be quite sure what
authority Livy is in the main following at any particular time;

he only mentions one by name, viz. Claudius (c. 42. 52. Q.
