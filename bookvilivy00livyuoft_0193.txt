and the Vestal Virgins, who were necessarily patrician maidens and
whose purity was regarded as of supreme importance. But there is also
a more particular allusion to the penetralia or shrine within the atrium
of the Vestals, in which were stored the most holy pledges of Rome’s
existence, among them the Palladium: cs. 5. 52. 7. None might enter
here except the Pontifices and the Vestals, whereas the Temple of Vesta
with the perpetual fire was accessible to the general public. See
especially Lanciani, Ancient Rome in the lsgrlzt cy* recent discovcries, pp.
134 ff.

¹8 patres auctores] The precise meaning of patrum auctoritas has
been the subject of rnuch dispute. The most probable view is that it
was the final act of sanction given by the patrician members of the
Senate to laws and elections made in the comitia; cf. c. 4²· 10: patricii
se auctores ficturos negabant. In connection with this chapter may be
quoted a passage from (Cicero) dc domo sua 14. 38 (cf. Seeley, Livy 1³⁴,
Introd. p. 63); it describes the effect of the disappearance os the
patriciate: ita populus Romanus brevi tempore neque regem sacrorum,
nequeflamines, nec salios habebit, nec ex parte dimidia reliquos sacerdotes,
neque auctores cenlurz'alorum el curiatorum comitiorum ,· auspiciaque
populi Romani, si magy'stralus patricii creati nan siut, intereant necesse ,
est, cum interrex nullus sil, quod et 2'p5um patricium esse et a patriciis
prodi necesse est. It almost looks as though Livy had had this passage
before him, when writing the present chapter.

10 bem Gallici] Cf. Plut. Cam. cc, 40, 41. The most interesting
feature of Plutarch’s account is the alteration in the Roman equipment,
said to have been introduced by Camillus at this time to repel the
onslaught os the Gauls. The latter were chiefly formidable on account
of the terrible blows which they inflicted with their long swordS. To
meet this danger, Camillus made the Roman soldiers wear smooth
