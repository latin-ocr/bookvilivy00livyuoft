XL! ξ 8] ΝΟ TES. r 49

3 ipsi] Explained by privati. Though they held no magistracy, the
patrician members of the Senate (patres in the restricted sense) had the
auspicia in their keeping, whenever the chief magistrates resigned without
holding the elections οἵ their successors (z'nlerr‘gnum).

4 interregem prodamus] See c. 1. 511.

privati] See Appendix.

6 §7- plebeios consules] Livy, in putting this argument into the
mouth of Appius, appears to have overlooked the fact that the plebeian
consular tribunes must have had the power of taking the auspices.

8 § 8. esse...pascantur] See Appendix. The words are in or.
obliqua, aud represent the arguments used by the scofi‘ers: ‘what does
it matter, if the sacred chickens resuse to seed?’ The pres. subj. indi-
cates several indefinite occasions, the perf. oue particular.

9 pulli] This method of augury was known as auspicia ex lrt'jvztdt'is3
it was especially resorted to upon military expeditioris owing to its con-
venience. The birds, generally ciricl<eris, were carried about in cages.
and the omen was drawn from the manner in which they fed. lf they
fed so eagerly that some of the food fell from their mouths, then the
omen was favourable (tripudium solt'slimmn); if they refused to seed, it
was unsavourable: cf. 10. 40. 4: nam cum pulli non pasceremur, pul-
larius aztspz'Zium mentiri ausus tripudium solz'slimmn consuli nuntiavit ;
also 9. ¹4· 4. It is evident from the present passage that reluctance
to come from the cage was also considered an evil omen.

The various methods of augury in vogue among the Romans may be

briefly mentioned. They are given by Festus, pp. 260, 2613 quinque
genera signorum observant augures publici, ex caelo, eac avibus, ex tri-
pudiis, ex quadrupedibus, ex diris. They included therefore the obser-
vation of (r) signs from the sky, particularly thunder and lightning.
(α) The ssight and eries of birds. (3) The behaviour of sacred chickens. Ι
(4) The rnovements of animals. (5) Miscellaneous warnings. The first
four were known as mgna-ia impetraliva, i.e. signs specially asked for,
the last as auguria oblativa, i.e. signs sent from heaven unasked for.

si occecinerit avis] ‘if a bird has uttered an ill-omened cry.' This
is probably to be referred to (2) in the note above. The observation
of the flight and eries of various birds was the oldest means of augury
employed at Rome (as we might infer from the word auspicium), though
later it fell into disuse. The present omen might, however, come
un‘der (5).

The use of the word osv-inere is another of Livy's archaisms3 cf.
c. 5. 7 n. For the soree of oh, cf. obnuntiatio.
