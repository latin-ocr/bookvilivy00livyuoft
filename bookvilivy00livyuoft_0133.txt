xm §Sl NOTES. 91

,12 ἓ 9. vana] Prolcptic, i.e. it anticipatus (προλαμβάνει) the result os
the action ς ‘when they have hurled their inmites, without ejffl’cl!

14 deos...deos] In spite os the scepticisni prevailing in his day, Livy
still has firm trust in the influence of the gods in human affairs, and
loves to depict his heroes as strong in saith.

The subj. of adiuvent and miserint is of course due to or. obliqua
after veniat in mentem3 ‘let each reineniber that it is the gods who
aid the Romans...'

Romanum] See c. 2. 1211.

16 ἓ 10. teum at] See Appendix.

17 haerere tam aciem collato pede] ‘ the lines fast-locked as men sight
hand to hand'3 cf. Verg. Aen. 11. 6 52: implicuere inter se acies legitque
virum vir. Weiss. quotes Aen. 10. 361 : haeret pede pes, densusque viro
vir. We can often find echoes of Virgil in Livy.

18 alio pavore] Pavore is more sorcible than labore. ‘Launch the
terror of the cavalry upon them when distracted with another sear‚’ i.e.
the sear inspired by the indomitable steadfastness of the Roman soot.
See Appendix.

20 ἓ n. nec dux legiones...] ‘the general did not fail the legions, nor
fortune fail the general.² Once more the Stoieshrluna.

CHAPTER XIII.

26 ἓ 1. nulli rei...freta] This constr. offrelus with the (lat. instead
of the normal abl. is peculiar to Livy. For another instance, cf. c. 3¹· 6:
discordiae hostium frctus. Apparently the dat. aster srelus is on the
analogy of that asterflelens3 cf. 8. 22. 7.

27 temere...temere] The word is connected etymologically with tme-
brae3 ‘entered upon the battle blindly, and abandoned it in blind panic.'

28 ἓ 2. missilibusque tens] Above (c. 12. 9), missilia is used alone.
This well illustrares the ease with which the neut. adj. became equivalent

to a subst.
29 ferox] ‘bold.'
31 §8- frons prima] The first line, corresponding to the Roman
hastati.
suum] Emphatic: ‘ a terror of its own.'
p. 18. 1. fluctuanti] ‘like a tossing sea.' Lit. ‘like a thing tossing'3
cf. Macaulay, Horatius, 50:
‘And on the tossing sea of steel
To and sro the standards reel.'
