6 cum...impediretur] ‘since ability to pay was being hampered by the
very fact that payment was a necessity) There i>- a strong emphasis on
necesse erat, which implies that immediate payment was required. Many
would be unable to pay at once owing to depreciation in the value of
land or from other temporary causes, whereas they could have managed
to do so, had time been allowed them.

must be supplied srom that in ne...quid‹⁷m.

year 376-5 B.c., but four names are given by Diodorus (¹5· 71. 1).

14 §4. acri experientique] ‘ol energy and enterpr1se’3 cf. Cic. pro
