140 LIVV. Vl. [xxxvn ξ 10

18 ξ 10. columen] Cf. our expression ‘ a pillar of the state)

21 ς· 11. imperium...n0b·111tatem] This is a good summary of the
changes actually brought about by the opening os the consulship to the
plebeians. A nobility of birth gave way to a nobility of office, since
the z'us imaginum, i.e. the right to have their waxen portraits set up in
the family atrium, was now opened to plebeians : the presence of these
portraits was the outward and visible sign of the nobility osa family.

magna ipsis fruenda, maiora liberis relinquenda] Literally:
‘ great things to be enjoyed by themselves, greater to be left to their
children‚’ i.e. ‘things great as sources of personal enjoyment‚ but greater
as bequests to hand on to their children.² The supine in -u would have
been the natural constr„ as Ltb. sayS, but the form is not found with
these verbs.

²4 ἓ 12. accipi] ‘were well received': in colloquial language, ‘went
down.’

pro duumviris sacris faciundis decemviri] See c. 5. 8n. where
the MSS. have the form sariendam Matters were not yet ripe for a
plebeian assault upon the genuinely Roman priesthoods. The keepers
os the Sibylline Books were priests of Apollo, a purely Greek deity,
and as such had nothing to do with the auspicia, which the patricians
regarded as belonging peculiarly to themselves.

25 pars] ‘half‚' as explained by c. 4²· 2.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.

33 ξ 1. circumactus est annus] The magisterial year ; cf. c. 1. 4n. :
anno circumacto.

p. 52. ‘2 nam] The connection with what goes before is not at first
sight apparent. Nam explains suspensa and dilata: ‘undecided and
postponed (but not abandoned), sor the plebs kept re-electing....’ Livy
does not imply that the elections of the military tribunes and of the
tribunes of the plebs were simultaneous3 he merely gives the reason sor
the delay in getting the measures passed.

3 qui] See Appendix.

7 § 8. tribus] The concilium plebis voting by tribes3 cf. ἓ 4.

9 ad...decu1·runt] ‘have recourse to.’ For the phrase, cf. c. 19. 3¹¹-
See Appendix.

a bodyv os men which itself eleets its new members, e.g. a priestly
collegium.
