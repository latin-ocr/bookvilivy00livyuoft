praetore] Later known as 1116 praetor urbanus in contragi to the
praetor peregrinus. 'she full significance of this eoneession on the part
of the plebs can only be graspcd by remcmbcring that praetores was the
early name of the highest magistrates of the state3 cf. 3. 55. η, and
Cic. Leg. 3. 3. 8: regio imperio duo sunto ; iique praeeundo, iudicando,
consulendo, praetores, iudices, consules appellamino (so MSS. ; some edd.
appellantor). Now that the sacred consulship had been thrown open
to the plebs, the patricians wished to retain sor themselves an office
which would at once deprive 1116 consulship of a part of its powers and
soothe their wounded vanity by its name; cf. 7. 1. 6. Β111 there was
also a more practical reason sor the creationi of the new magistr-acy. The
consuls now had their time so sully occupied with the conduct of military
affairs, that it was impossible that they could adequately superintend the
administration os justice. The practorship was thrown open to the
plcbeians in 337 ηε. Cf. Greenidgc, Roman Public lasse, pp. 120 ff.

Κάμιλλος, εἰς τὴν ἀγορὰν καὶ τὴν ἐκκλησίαν ἄποπτον ἐπὶ τοῖς ’γεγενη-
μένοις ἱδρύσασθαι. This was the temple sacing the Forum below the
Mons Capitolinus. See map.

merito...deum immortalium fore] ‘would be in accordance with
the merit of the iunnortal gods'3 cs. Cic. acl Att. 5. 11. 6: et hercule
merito tuo feci, ‘1 acted in accordancc with your desert? Weiss.
quotes 28. 9. 8: st’...‹1'ccernere patres merito deorum primum, dein,
semndum deos, consulum responderunt. See Appendix.

si quando unquam alias] The redundancy of the phrase is note-
worthy. This characteristic of Livy makes it necessary to employ
caution in bracketing seemingly unnecessary words.

ut...adiiceretur] Depends at once on dignam and id, being ex-
planatory os both: ‘that the occasion was worthy (os the celebrationi)
