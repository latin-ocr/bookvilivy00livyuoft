story. According to 5. 50. 7, the gold demanded by the G'auls was

supplied by the Roman matrons, not by a tributum, or general property

tax. That story was, no doubt, an invention. To supply the immediate
deman‘d gold was probably borrowed from temples and individuals alike‚

θ’ and was subsequently repaid by money raised by a regular tributum.
This version did not commend itsels to the pride of the Roman historians.

2 cessisse] Followed by in and aec. = ‘to become-³ The phrase in
this sense is post-Ciceronian3 cf. abire in. i

§1:3. exsequebantur quaerendo] ‘thcy enquired pertinaciously.’
Lit. ‘they followed up by asking.’

4 differentique] The -7‘ (orm of the abl. of the pres. part. is common
when the part. is used as an adj„ as in the osten recurring insequenti
anno, but not otherwise. Weiss. here explains (iffa-enti as abl. abs.,
holding that the -i form has been adopted to avoid the disagreeable
sound of diſj‘k‘raenteqnae cf. 1. 54. 6, sequenti‚sor a similar -z’ form in an
abl. abs. In the present case, however, dzffi’renli and dicenti might be
explained as free datives of the person interested. &And when he en-
deavoured to put them off...he found‚' etc. Ltb. explains them as
datives of the agent to be taken with versae erant onmium curae. Cf„
for a similar constr.‚ 23. 12. 1: tantus acervus fuit, ut metientibus
supra tres modios eaplesse sint quidam auctores ς also ἕ 2, above, intuenti.

6 mediamJ=mediocrem, cf. 2. 49. 5: nihil medium-...sed immensa
omnia volventium animo. Affedz'am is to be taken with both gratiam
and ‹ffinsi0nem‚ its position rendering it more emphatic.

CHAPTER XV.

ιι ξ 1. pertentatus] ‘having tested.’ Distinguish this meaning from
the intrans. use of the word, ‘to be in danger,’ e.g. in 40. 15. ηε cnm
quid aliud quam z'ngem‘ifama periclitarer?

η senatum] For a similar proceeffing, cf. 5. 50. 8 : in contionem
universo senatu prosequente escendit (Camillus). It seems to have been
the custom on important occasions for the Senate, after meeting in the
Curia, to support the leading magistrate by forming his escort.

1 3 ξ 2. in comitio] A space in front of the Senate House, which had
been consecrated by the augurs. Varro (L. L. 5. ¹155) says: comitium
ab co, qnod coibant eo Comitiis C uriatis et litium causa. Contiones
were frequently held in the Comitium, which was on higher ground than
