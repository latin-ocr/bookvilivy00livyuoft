The speech of Appius Claudius is au interesting example of the way
in which Livy seeks to give vividness to a situation by bringing forward
a person to express the feelings of a whole class of men concerned in it.
The speech may be regarded as summing up the objections to the com-
pulsory election of one plebeian consul, and the grounds upon which
the patrieians rested their claims to exclusive possession of the chief
magistracy. The following is a brief analysis: C. 40. I deny that our
clau has always opposed the interests of the plcb53 it has only done so
when they were detrimental to the interests of the state as a whole
(ἓξ 3-7). On the present occasion the proposals of Licinius and Sextius
simply amount to a plot to deprive the people of their right to choose

‚the chief magistrates from whomsoever they will (§§ 8-20). C. 41.
The basest plebeian will be able to force himself into the consulship
(§§ 1-5)-

But all this concerns human equity me1·ely; I now come to the
offence in the sight of heaven. Patricians only are qualified to consult
the gods by the auspices, and therefore patricians only can be elected
consuls without impiety against the gods. Remember, it is only by our
careful observance of religion that we have grown great (ἓὲ 4-12).

5 ξ 1. prae] The strictest prose writers employ prae, in causal sense,
only after a neg. Livy does not always observe this rule ; cf. 5. 13. 13:
praemetet. . ,obiectis foribus extremos suorum exclusere.

stupor silentiumque inde] ‘amazement and then (i-e. in consequence)
silence.’

6 defixissetJ' The whole phrase has a poetica] ring about it. Perhaps
Livy is again indebted to Virgi13 cf. Aen. 1. 495: dum slupet obtutuque
haeret de xus in uno.

ἓ 2. App. Claudius Crassus] Prof. Mommsen (Hz'st. of Rome,
vol. 1. App.) has shown that there is reason to believe that the character
of the Claudii has been consistently misrepresented by Livy, who
perhaps follows the annalist Licinius Macer. Examination of the
political actions of members of the elan does not reveal a bitter hostility
to the plebs. For the force of ob, cf. obnuntiatis.
