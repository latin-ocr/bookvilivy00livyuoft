ι’] ξ 3. populares suos] MSS. Mdg. bracketed populares, Duker suos.
The former is inore likely to have bccn a gloss. Kraffert viros sor suos
(so ll. J. M. and Zingerle). XVciss. patronas, aml Ltb. patronos suos.

§5 Capitolino] MSS. Bracketed by Kiehl. Mdg.⁷s later con-
jecture Capitolini is not improbable in view of such passages as 7. 4. 3
and 7. 32. 15. It is adopted by Zingerle.

ἕ 6. quod] Mdg. after Doujat. MSS. z'd quod. 11.J. M. eo quod.

18 § 1. sub exitum] Mdg.; MSS. sub exitu.

ξ 3. iam] Gronovius. M iam itt, other MSS. in. H. J. M.
thinks in propinquum arose from in propinquo a gloss on aderat.

§a quot enim] MSS.; Mdg. quatem* (cf. Cic. acl Au. 12. 33).

ἓ 12. [etham] Gronovius. MSS. eliam.

19 §4 εἴ, ei] Mdg. after Stroth (Cic. defin. Exeursus 1); MSS. et,
which A. Perizonius removed as corrupt.

20 §8. produxit] MSS. Bracketed by Mdg. Ltb. adopts Rhenanus'
conjecture produxisse, and alters nominatum into nominaw'ssffl he
further changes iuter quos into interque cos. This gives a good sense,
but sails to account for the corruption. Zing. follows Ltb., but keeps
nominatum.

nominatim] Mdg. for nominatum of MSS.; Mommsen, leam.
Fursclz. 2. pp. 185, 186 n., thinks that if Mdg.'s reading is adopted,
absentem, which is pointless‚ must be struck out as well as produxit.

22 ἓ 1. tribunis] Several Edd. bracket this word after Muret. ,

23 ἓ 5. rapere] So the better MSS. Capere, the reading of the inferior
MSS„ is adopted by Ltb. and Zingerle, and recommended by H. J. M.

ἓ 11. eam] T. Faber. MSS. etiam.

“ 24 ἓ 10. fluctuante acie] Heerwagen. MSS. fluctuantem aciem,

except Ml, which has fluctuantem acie. Mdg. suggested (non) in

fluctuantem aciem trudi equos. Would not trahi be less of a change
and give a better sense? Possibly ex fluctuante acie extrahi might be
rig ht, the corruption having arisen srom the alteration of tralzi into tradi.

25 ἓ 7. itineri] So Edd generally for itm ’ris of the MSS„ which is,
however possible.

27 §3- invidiosius] Mdg.; MSS. z‘wnvulzae ctus. Duker invzdt'ose.
