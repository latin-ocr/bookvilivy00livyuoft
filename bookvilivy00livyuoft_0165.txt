CHAPTER XXVIII.

‘29 § 1. certum] There is no occasion to adopt the conjecture creatum.
The meaning clearly is that the Romans no longer had a ‘definite’
leader in the person of Camillus, and were therefore likely to be
without any concerted plan of dcfenee; cf. 3. 50. 16: nullodum cerlo
duce, and 9. 45. 10: sine ducibus certis. See Appendix.

31 ἓ 2. acto] ‘set in motion! The better MSS. readsacto, which might
be right, the meaning in that case being, ‘an army having been hurricdly
got together!

protinus] ‘continuously.’ The word stands for pro-tenus, ‘right
sorward‚' the e being changed to z' through the shifting of accent (cf.
c. 16. 2 n. on sicine). The meaning ‘ continuously ’ is therefore more in
accordance with the etymology of the word than is the more common
‘ forthwith.' Cf. quatenm.

which the via Praenestina entered Rome. The Praenestines therefore
extended their ravages farther N. to the via Nomentana, which led up to

meaning ‘and’ immediately before ac used in the comparative sense
of ‘as-⁹ The Romans could not have been so sensitive upon such a
point as we are ; cf. c. 30. 8: indc...z'nde.

ἰο ἓ ’1. obnoxia] ‘servile’; cf. Ovid Met. 5. 235: summissaeque
manus famesque obnoxia mansit. The primary meaning of the word
is ‘ liable to punishment.’
