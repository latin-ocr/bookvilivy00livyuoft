a negative, since desierant is virtually negative. So we find ullus without
a neg. aster vetare ; cf. Cic. A'ep. 1. 17. 27: communis lex naturae, quae
vetat ullam rem esse cuiusquam.

5 quippe] ‘sor of course-¹

6 § 7. in. animo] As a rule Livy uses animis without in with
deslt‘nare3 but since we cannot be sure that he would never use in animo,
it seems best to keep the reading of the MSS„ especially as it is supported
by τι. 44. 9: destinatum in animo. See Appendix.

9 confusus animo] ‘overcome with emotion'; cf. c. 34. 8.

ιο 5 8. [dictatorem] Madvig was no doubt right in bracketing this
word. Camillus' fourth dictatorship came later (368 B.C.; c. 38. 4); he
was now consular tribune sor the fourth time. The statement is,
moreover, wrong from a constitutional point of view, since the dictator
was not elected by the people, but nominated by a consul. Perhaps
dictatorem has ousted tribunum. See Appendix.

12 honorato] ‘complimentary.’ The word is used in an active sense
and=honorzficzts3 cf. 27. το. 6: honoraltssimo decreto. See Appendix.

19 ἓ u. ab invidia et odio] Cf. c. 3. 8: accensum ab desperalione
hostium. Invidia and oah'um are practically personified.

21 ξ 12. Ι..- valeri] This person must be identical with the P. Valerius
mentioned above, so Livy seems to have made a slip in the name.

24 ἓ 18. ad urbem] See Appendix.

intentum, sive...] ‘ on the alert, in case of a rising...’

26 ita rem gesturum] sc. le. Mr Giles suggests that te has dropped
out of the MSS. after ila, and this seems very likely.

28 ἓ 14. ex causariis senioribusque] The causariz' were men excused
military service on account of ill-health or bodily infirmity. Weiss.
quotes Daegr. 3. 2. 2: camaria (missio), quae propler valetudinem laboribus
militiae solvit. For seniores, cs. c. 2. 611.

29 praesidio] Predicative or final dat.‚ expressing the purpose of the
enrolment of the army. See Roby, Syntax pp. xxv ff.

3ο trumentum] Observe that the singular as a rule denotes gathered
grain, the plur. frumenta unharvested corn, cf. 2 3. 32. 14: ut frumenta
(the crops) ex agris...convelzereut. The plur. also denotes various kinds
of corn.

alia] See Appendix.

3¹ ἓ 1⁵. praesidem huius publici consilii] Not any extraordinary
position, such as that of praefectus urbi, is meant. As Ser. Cornelius
was the only consular tribune left in Rome, to him would naturally fall
the task oi summoning the Senate and of presiding in it, of superintending
