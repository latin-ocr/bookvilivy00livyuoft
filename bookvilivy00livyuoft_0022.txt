xvi LIVY. Vl

he is to believe anything which would sully the sair same of
Camillus (c. 38. 10); he feels that all that is great in Rome has
been built up by the stern virtues of her ‘amous men.

His reveretzce sor relzgz'on. Closely allied to Livy’s moral
earnestness is his reverence sor the Roman religion. His Stoic
belief in the power of fate does not shake his confidence in the
influence of the gods; and this is no light thing, especially when
it is remembered that he lived in an age when scepticism was
the fashion. ‘ Credo rem Antialem diuturniorem manere dis
cordi ficc'sse' he writes in c. 9. 3. His victorious general Cossus
eries out to the troops with all the fervour of a Crusader ‘veniat
in mentem unicnique deos esse, qui Romanum adiuvent, deos,
qui secundis avibus z'n proelium miserint) Throughout this
book the part played by relzgrio in early Roman history is

strongly accentuated, and the speech of Appius (c. 41. 4 ff.) ,

gives us some idea of the Roman reverence for the auspicia
before the time when they were degraded to the position of
political instruments by men who had long since abandoned all
belief in the reality of the gods.

§3 LIVY AS WRITER AND STYLIST.

Just as Livy’s life was passed under both the old and the
new forms of government, the Republic and the Empire, so his
language may be said to hover between two styles of Latinity.
lt occupies a middle position between the golden Latin of Cicero
and Caesar and the silver Latin of Tacitus and the Younger
Pliny. Livy's Latin does not indeed diverge to a very great
extent from that of Cicero 3 but the lapse from the latter’s high
ideal of purity ,comes out every now and again in a certain
freedom of construction which prose writers had not before
permitted themselves, in the use of new words, in the adoption
of poetical turns of expression, from all which it can be seen
that Livy is leading the way to what is known as silver Latinity.
As conspicuous examples of this tendency may be mentioned
the use of non dubito with the acc. and inf„ of the subjunctive to
express frequency of action or occurrence, of fretus with the
dative, aud the giving of an adjectival meaning to adver-bs,
