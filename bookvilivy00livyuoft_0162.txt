so used herc ‘ you shall have.’ It is, however, possible to give the tense

its usual force, ‘you will have had from me the power of plea‹1ing,’
whatever the issue may be.

quem] se. dare.

§4. dictator] The dictators of the Latin cities are to be distin·
guished from the Roman dictators. We find them at Alba, Lanuvium,
Tusculum, Nomentum, and elsewhere; cs. Cic. [ro Mil. ιο. 27. Some-
times, as at Alba, the annual dictator was a purely religious functionary,
somewhat resembling the rex sacrorum :it l<01ne; but more osten he
was a civil magistrate, and the office a survival of an original Latin
kingship. The commoner name sor the chief Latin magistrates was
praetores or dmmtvz'rz'. The Roman dictator, on the other hand, was
τι quite extraordinary magistrate, and had nothing in common (except
the name) with the annual dictators of the Latin cities. It seems pro-
bable that Julius Caesar, in accepting the dictatorship for life, had the
Latin, rather than the Roman, magistracy in mind. Cs. 3. 18. 2, and
see Mommsen, Hist. of Rome (Eng. Trans.) 1. p. 44211.

quibus] ‘ we, against whom)

§5. plebis] We must remember that Rome was originally only
one among many Latin townships‚ all pretty well on a level with regnrd
to power. It is not therefore surprising to fmd many of the familiar
institutions of Rome existing elsewhere in Latium.

nisi si quando] ‘unless some day?

auribus] i.e. the false rumours of Tusculan disaffection.

sicubi]:sl-(c)ul›1'‚ ‘if anywhere‚' ‘wherever’3 cs. necubi, sicunde
necunde.

di immortales faciant, tam felix, quam pta] ‘may the gods make
it as happy in its issue, as it is right.’ The expressionznt tam felix sit
quam pia est.

§¹7. quod ad crimina...censemus] The sentence as it stands is
hardly intelligihle. We must conclude that Livy forgot the drift of the
first half of the sentence, and wrote down what he imagined to be a
contr-ast to it; or, if a — were put aster tamen, it might he supposed
that the speaker broke off suddenly at that point. ‘With regard to the
charges against us, which induced you to declare war, although there is
no point in disproving by words what is resuted by facts, yet-(sc. I will
not resusc to do so); even if the charges were true, etc.’

The simplest course, however, is to regard etsi as an interpolation
(it might easily have come in from etiamsi following), and to place a
