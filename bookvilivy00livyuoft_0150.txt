illi capctzsum tulerit, ‘whereas D. credited Verres with a less sum
than Verres put down as paid to him.’
32 venire] From veneo, ‘ I am sold.'
prohibuisset] Possibly by inducing the tribunes of the plebs to
interfere in their behalf, but more probably, as in the case of the
centurion (c. 14), by paying their debts for them.
§ '7- ad haec] ‘in addition to this.’ More usually ad hoc, as below. χ
33 decora beni] ‘ military distinctions-³
p. 28. 2 in quibus]=ct ineis.

3 murales coronas] The man, who first scaled the walls of a besieged
city, was granted a golden crown decorated with turrets: cf. the mural
crown which appears upon the head of Cybele, e-g. upon coins of
Smyrna (Hill, Greek and Roman Coins, Pl. V111. 10); cf. Gell. 5. 6. 16.

civicas] The corona civica was presented to the Roman soldier who
had preserved the life of a citizen in battle. The crown was made from
leaves of different kinds of oak, and bore the words ob civem servatum.
Augustus was granted the corona civica by the Senate, and upon coins
os his appears the oak-crown with the words ob cives servatos. Cf.
Pliny N. H. 16. 11 and Gell. 5. 6. 11.

4 ξ 8. [produxit] The MSS. read produxit and nominatum. The
least unsatisfactory emendation is that of Madvig, viz. to strike out
produxit and to change nominatum into nominatim. In that case
commemorasse must be supplied from above. The insertion of produxit
may be due to a copyist, who failed to understand the absence of a verb
aster cives

Yet this reading is not free from difficulty. Manlius mentioned and
showed the crowns he had won by saving the lives of citizens3 there
would not be much point in adding that he mentioned the ‚fact that he
had preserved citizens from the enemy; we should rather expect to find
that he brought them forward in person. There is a further awkward-
ness in the necessity of supplying commemorasse from above, when
protulisse has followed'it. See Appendix.

inter quos] z et inter eos.

5 mag-istrum equitum] Pliny (N. H. 7. 103) says: P. (read C.)
San-silium magistrum equitum sewaverat, {fise volneratus umerum,
scmur. Livy’s meaning must therefore be that Manlius had rescned
Servilius some years before (perhaps in 389 B.C.), when the latter was
Mastcr of the Horse, not that Servilius was Master of the Horse at the
present time (ct. c. 2. 6). κ

6 pro fastigio rerum] ‘proportioned to the height os his exploits.'
