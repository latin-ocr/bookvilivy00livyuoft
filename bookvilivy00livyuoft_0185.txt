xxxlx ξ 7] NOTES. 143

3ο velut per interregnum] The consular tribunes were nonentities.

31 latoribus] Cf. c. 37. in. lt is there iinplied that the tribunes'
interest in 'the relies os the ple-helan debtor's dista-ess was merely
seigned.

33 ᾖ 2. iubebant...antiquabant] It is very important to express the
soree of the imperf. rightly. We must say ‘they were proceeding to
pass‚' or something equivalent. The absence of a conjunction (asyndeton)
serves to bring out a contrast, as osten.

p. 54. 1 in omnia. simul] i.e. they were putting the question with a
view to forcing through all the measures together. ln here expresses
purpose, as in 21. 43. 7: in laeanc tam opimam mercedem agz'le3 cf. the
common in spem (c. 11. 5).

A law which embraced several proposals of distinct character was
known as a lex satura3 cf. Festus s.v. satura: satura et cibi genus
dicitur ex variis rebus condilum, et lex multis aliis conserta legebus, et
genus carminis ubi de mullis rebus disputatur. It can easily be under-
stood that such laws might be very dangerous, inasmuch as the bad
could be forced through with the good.

3 §8- C. Licinio] This cannot be the tribune of the plebs, but was
no doubt some near relation. The prominence of the Licinii in these
chapters makes it probable that Livy is here following the annalist
Licinius Macer (1st cent. ¹3.c.)‚ who wrote with a strong democratic bias.

ξ 4. tribum consularis] Refer>- back to the statement that Licinius
had been tribunus militum (consulari potestate). Manlius pleaded that,
in appointing Licinius his Master-of—Horse‚ he was showing no more
favour to the plebs than the whole people had shown in electing the
same man consular tribune3 cf. ²3- 11. 10: magistrum equitum, quae
consularis potestas sit, fusum ficgatum. As a matter of fact the

Magister Equitum, being entirely subordinate to the dictator, had not

as much influence as a consular tribune.

η ἕ 6. privatim...publice] A striking example of the use of adverbs
in an adjectival sense. Note that this is helped out by their position
between the adj. and the subst.; cf. c. 4. 1 n.

ι 3 consenuisse] ‘had lost their natural sorce.’ For this sense of con-
senescere, cf. Cic. ad Att. 2. 13. 2: quanta in odio noster amicus
Magnus! cuius cognomen una cum Crassi Divitis cognomine consenesct't5
Pompey‘s title of Magnus had lost its force.

16 §7- ablegatione] A rare word used instead of the commonet
relegatio. The war had been made a pretext sor sending the plebeian
voters into an honourable banishment.
