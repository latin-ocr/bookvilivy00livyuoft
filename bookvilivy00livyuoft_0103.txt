NOTES.

CHAPTER Ι.

p. 1. 1 ἓξ 1, 2. The opening sentence is long and should bc read
through carefully besorc translation. The nmin outline is: ‘ I have set
forth ..the history of Rome, a history at once (cum) obscure by reason os
its exceeding antiquity‚...and obscure also (mm) because the literary
records...were scanty, and because whatever there was...perishe(l.’ ⁴

4 · ἕ 1. ab condita urbe] This seerns to support the common assump-
tion that the“title‚ under which Livy’s history was published, was Ab
urbe [ondita lt'brz'3 cs. the title of the Annals of Tacitus, Ab excessu div!
Augusti libri. Translate: ⁴ from the foundation os the city? The part.
pass. in agreement with a subst. is frequently used instead of a subst.
with another in the gen. depending on it.

ad captam eandem urbem] The capture of Rome by the Gauls
had been narrated by Livy in Book V. Probably a new section of the
work begins with Book vx, as is indicated by thc short pre-face contained
in this chapter. Cs. Introd. ξ 1.

5⁴ consulibus...ac dictatoribus, decemVfflS...t1-ibunis consularibus]
The two magistracies which were in the nature of experiments arc
placed in contrast with the consulship and dictatorship. The decem-
virate lasted srom 451—449 Rc. 3 its principal work was the drawing up
of the code of laws known as the XII Tables. The consular tribunate
was established in 444 Bc, partly with the object os opening up to the
plebeians the powers of the consulship without its more external
dIgnities‚ and partly with a view to creating a larger number of military
commanders.

8 §2- velut quaej--vclnl ea sunl quac, ‘as is the case with thing<
which.’
