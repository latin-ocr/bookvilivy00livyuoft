60 days, towards the end of which period the debtors were again brought
before the praetor on three consecutive market days (nundinae). Then,
if the debt still remained unpaid and no surety came sorward‚ the
debtors might be sold as slaves (or, as some maintain, actually be cut in
pieces‚ and in this way ‹listributed among their creditors); cf. the
language of the XII Tables. Tertiis nundinis partis secante. Sa· plus

minusve secuerunt, se (πείνη) fraude esto. It is therefore not surprising >

to find constant (listurbance arising from the harsh operation of these
laws ε cf. Tac. Ann. 6. 16. 2 ff„ and Introd. §40-

32 nervo] Festus defines nervus as ferreum vimulum quo pedes
impediuntur, but he goes on to say: quamquam l'lautus eo etiam
cervices vinciri ait. Thus the nervus seems to have corresponded
pretty well to our stocks and pillory combined. Cf. the ξύλον πεντεσύριγγον
of Aristoph. Eq. ¹049·

33 ἓ 9. et] Notice the emphatic character of this et at the beginning
of a sentence: ‘and indeed‚' cf. 2. 28. 8: et apparebat atrox cum plebe
certamen. In spite of assistance from the state the poorer plebeians must
have borrowed largely in order to rebuild and restock their sarms aster
the devastation wrought by the Gauls.

13 ἓ 1. celeritate...opus erat] The abl. is instrumental, as is the abl.
astersrnor, fungor, etc.; cf. the abl. aster usus esl. The alternative constr„
in which opus is used as a secondary predicate and the thing needed is
the subject, is also quite regular: cf. Cic. ad fiam. 2. 6. 4: dux nobis ct
auctor opus est. But the gen., which occurs occasionally in Livy aster
opus est, is a constr. peculiar to him. Cf. τε. 51. 3: ad consilium
pensandum temporis opus esse.

16 ἓ 2. non dubIto] The Ciceronian constr. after non dubito (meaning
‘I (lo not doubt ³) is regularly quin with the subj. Livy constantly has
the acc. and inf.; Cornelius Nepos (about roo—30 Rc.) also has this
constr„ but its use marks a decline from the standard of'strict Latinity.

17 bella cum Volscis] Cf. Introd. g 4b. ,

19 propiores temporibus harum rerum auctores] Livy probably
refers particularly to Q. Fabius Pictor (about 200 B.C.), who wrote in
Greek. Fabius was the earliest Roman historian‚ but even he wrote
over a* century and a half aster the V olscian wars here recorded. The

present statement might lead us to suppose that Livy had studied the
