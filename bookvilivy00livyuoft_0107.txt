1§12] NOTES. 65

It seems possible that we have an actual specimen osa lex regia
preserved in a fragmentary Latin inscription, a cast of which is in the
British Museum. It was discovered in 1899 on the site of the Comitium
and is written in arehaic Greek letters. It perhaps gives directions as
to the place and time at which certain sacrifices are to be made and
indicates the penalty in case of contravention. The date of the in-
scription is probably to be placed early in the 6th century B.C., and
it is likely that its mutilation took place at the time os the Gallie
invasion. The interpretation, however, is very uncertain.

quae comparerent] ‘ So sar as they were to be sound.’ Or. rectae
conquirantur, (si) quae compareant.

28 ὅ u. diebus religiosis] Cf. Gellius 4. 9. 5. He defines dies
religiosi as tristi omine et infames impeditique, in quibus et res divinas
facere et rem quampiam novam exordiri temperandum est. Upon these
days it was considered extremely unlucky to embark upon any important
business. The dies nefasti, on the other hand, were the days upon
which the law-courts were closed. Dies relz'gzbsz‘ were also known as
dies atri. “

29 a.d. xv Kal. Sextiles] July rSth. So Tacitus Hist. 2. 91 speaks
os infausto die Cremerensi Alliensique cladibus3 ef. also Lucan 7. 409:
et damnata diu Romanis Allia fastis.

ad cremeram] The disaster to the Fabii is assigned to the year
477 B.c. (11. 50). The Cremera was a tributary os the Tiber, and flowed
past Veii. See map.

32 insignemque rel nulli...ag·endae] Trans, ι ‘ and marked it out sor
doing no business, public or private.’ The dat. after insignis is one os
purpose, as in ιο. 39. 14: zct...sp072·a ea referrent, quae insigma publicis
etiam locis decorandis essent t ‘which were marked out for the de-
coration...' For various emendations which have been suggested see
Appendix.

p. 3. 1 §e 12. posu-1⁶10 mus Quintues] Juiy 16th. Quintilis was
the 5th mouth of the old Roman year, which began with March. Later
on Quintilis was changed into Julius in honour of Julius Caesar.
Similarly Sextilis, originally the 6th month, had its name changed in
honour of Augustus.

The acc. after postridie and pridie is on the analogy os that after
post and ante. The gen. is found rarely, e.g. in Caes. B. G. 1. 47. 2:
pridie eius diei.
